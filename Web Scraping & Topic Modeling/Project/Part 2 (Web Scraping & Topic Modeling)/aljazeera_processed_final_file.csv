"Israeli ultra-Orthodox party quits Netanyahu government over conscription","Resignation of United Torah Judaism lawmakers leaves Netanyahu with razor-thin 61-seat majority in the 120 seat Knesset.","Published On 15 Jul 202515 Jul 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/15/israeli-ultra-orthodox-party-quits-netanyahu-government-over-conscription","tag/israel-palestine-conflict/","Israel’s ultra-Orthodox party, United Torah Judaism (UTJ), has announced it is quitting the country’s fractious right-wing coalition due to a long-running dispute over mandatory military service, threatening Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hold on power. Six of the remaining seven members of UTJ, which is comprised of the Degel HaTorah and Agudat Yisrael factions, wrote letters of resignation, Israeli media reported late on Monday. UTJ chairman Yitzhak Goldknopf had resigned a month ago. A spokesperson for Goldknopf confirmed that, in all, seven UTJ Knesset members are leaving the government. Degel HaTorah was quoted by news reports as saying the decision was made “in accordance with the directive” of the group’s spiritual leader, Rabbi Dov Lando. Degel Hatorah said in a statement that after conferring with its head rabbis, “and following repeated violations by the government of its commitments to ensure the status of holy yeshiva students who diligently engage in their studies … [its MKs] have announced their resignation from the coalition and the government”. The decision would leave Netanyahu with a razor-thin majority of 61 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament. It was not clear whether Shas, another ultra-Orthodox party, would follow suit.    Ultra-Orthodox lawmakers have long threatened to leave the coalition over the conscription bill. They argue that a bill to exempt “yeshiva” or seminary students from conscription was a key promise in their agreement to join Netanyahu’s coalition in late 2022. In June, on the eve of Israel’s war with Iran, the coalition barely survived after governing lawmakers reached a deal with ultra-Orthodox parties regarding exemptions to the mandatory military service. The ultra-Orthodox have long been exempt from military service, which applies to most other young Israelis. But last year, the Supreme Court ordered the Ministry of Defense to end that practice and start conscripting seminary students. Netanyahu had been pushing hard to resolve the deadlock over the new military conscription bill, which has led to the present crisis. He is under pressure from his own Likud party to draft more ultra-Orthodox men and impose penalties on dodgers, a red line for the Shas party, which demands a law guaranteeing its members’ permanent exemption from military service. Netanyahu’s coalition, formed in December 2022, is one of the most far-right governments in the country’s history.","israel ultra orthodox party unite torah judaism utj announce quit country fractious right wing coalition due long run dispute mandatory military service threaten prime minister benjamin netanyahu hold power six remain seven member utj comprise degel hatorah agudat yisrael faction write letter resignation israeli medium report late monday utj chairman yitzhak goldknopf resign month ago spokesperson goldknopf confirm seven utj knesset member leave government degel hatorah quote news report say decision make accordance directive group spiritual leader rabbi dov lando degel hatorah say statement confer head rabbi follow repeat violation government commitment ensure status holy yeshiva student diligently engage study mks announce resignation coalition government decision leave netanyahu razor thin majority seat seat knesset parliament clear whether shas another ultra orthodox party follow suit ultra orthodox lawmaker long threaten leave coalition conscription bill argue bill exempt yeshiva seminary student conscription key promise agreement join netanyahu coalition late june eve israel war iran coalition barely survive govern lawmaker reach deal ultra orthodox party regard exemption mandatory military service ultra orthodox long exempt military service apply young israeli last year supreme court order ministry defense end practice start conscript seminary student netanyahu push hard resolve deadlock new military conscription bill lead present crisis pressure likud party draft ultra orthodox man impose penalty dodger red line shas party demand law guarantee member permanent exemption military service netanyahu coalition form december one far right government country history"

"Israel bombards Gaza, killing 78, as truce talks stall","The attacks come amid a worsening hunger crisis as Israel severely restricts entry of food, fuel, water and medicines.","Published On 14 Jul 202514 Jul 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/14/israel-continues-to-pound-gaza-killing-72-as-truce-talks-stall","tag/israel-palestine-conflict/","Israeli forces have continued to pound the besieged Gaza Strip, killing at least 78 Palestinians, including several aid seekers, as ceasefire talks stall amid a deepening fuel and hunger crisis. An Israeli attack near an aid distribution point in Rafah in southern Gaza killed at least five people who were seeking aid on Monday, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. The killings raised the death toll of Palestinians killed near aid sites run by the controversial Israeli and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) to 838, according to Wafa. In Khan Younis, also in southern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a displacement camp killed nine people and wounded many others. In central Gaza’s Bureij refugee camp, four people were killed when an Israeli air strike hit a commercial centre, Wafa said.    Israeli forces also resumed stepping up attacks in northern Gaza and Gaza City. Israeli media reported an ambush in Gaza City, with a tank hit by rocket fire and later, with small arms. A helicopter was seen evacuating casualties. The Israeli military later confirmed that three soldiers were killed in the incident. Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said Israeli forces responded with “massive air strikes in the vicinity of [the] Tuffah and Shujayea neighbourhoods, levelling residential buildings”. The Wafa news agency said at least 24 Palestinians were killed in Gaza City and dozens more were wounded. The attacks come as UN agencies continue to plead for more aid to be allowed into Gaza, where famine looms and a severe fuel shortage has brought the already battered healthcare sector to its knees. Gaza’s water crisis has also intensified since Israel blocked nearly all fuel shipments into the enclave on March 2. With no fuel, desalination plants, wastewater treatment facilities and pumping stations have largely shut down. Egypt’s foreign minister said on Monday that the flow of aid into Gaza has not increased despite an agreement last week between Israel and the European Union that should have had that result. “Nothing has changed [on the ground],” Badr Abdelatty told reporters ahead of the EU-Middle East meeting in Brussels. The EU’s top diplomat said on Thursday that the bloc and Israel agreed to improve Gaza’s humanitarian situation, including increasing the number of aid trucks and opening crossing points and aid routes. When asked what steps Israel has taken, Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Gideon Saar referred to an understanding with the EU but did not provide details on the implementation. Asked if there were improvements after the agreement, Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates Ayman Safadi told reporters that the situation in Gaza remains “catastrophic”. “There is a real catastrophe happening in Gaza resulting from the continuation of the Israeli siege,” he said. Meanwhile, stuttering ceasefire talks entered a second week on Monday, with mediators seeking to close the gap between Israel and Hamas. The indirect negotiations in Qatar appear to still remain deadlocked after both sides blamed the other for blocking a deal for the release of captives and a 60-day ceasefire.    An official with knowledge of the talks said they were “ongoing” in Doha on Monday, the AFP news agency reported. “Discussions are currently focused on the proposed maps for the deployment of Israeli forces within Gaza,” the source reportedly said. “Mediators are actively exploring innovative mechanisms to bridge the remaining gaps and maintain momentum in the negotiations,” the source added on condition of anonymity. Hamas accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who says he wants to see the Palestinian group destroyed, of being the main obstacle. “Netanyahu is skilled at sabotaging one round of negotiations after another, and is unwilling to reach any agreement,” the group wrote on Telegram. Netanyahu is under growing pressure to end the war, with military casualties rising and public frustration mounting. He also faces backlash over the feasibility and ethics of a plan to build a so-called “humanitarian city” from scratch on the ruins of southern Gaza’s Rafah to house 600,000 Palestinians if and when a ceasefire takes hold. Israel’s security establishment is reported to be unhappy with the plan, which the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said amounts to plans for a “concentration camp”.","israeli force continue pound besiege gaza strip kill less palestinian include several aid seeker ceasefire talk stall amid deepen fuel hunger crisis israeli attack near aid distribution point rafah southern gaza kill less five people seek aid monday official palestinian news agency wafa report killing raise death toll palestinian kill near aid site run controversial israeli us back gaza humanitarian foundation ghf accord wafa khan younis also southern gaza israeli strike displacement camp kill nine people wound many other central gaza bureij refugee camp four people kill israeli air strike hit commercial centre wafa say israeli force also resume step attack northern gaza gaza city israeli medium report ambush gaza city tank hit rocket fire late small arm helicopter see evacuate casualty israeli military late confirm three soldier kill incident al jazeera tareq abu azzoum report deir el balah say israeli force respond massive air strike vicinity tuffah shujayea neighbourhood level residential building wafa news agency say less palestinian kill gaza city dozen wound attack come un agency continue plead aid allow gaza famine loom severe fuel shortage bring already batter healthcare sector knee gaza water crisis also intensify since israel block nearly fuel shipment enclave march fuel desalination plant wastewater treatment facility pump station largely shut egypt foreign minister say monday flow aid gaza increase despite agreement last week israel european union result nothing change grind badr abdelatty tell reporter ahead eu middle east meet brussels eu top diplomat say thursday bloc israel agree improve gaza humanitarian situation include increase numb aid truck open cross point aid route ask step israel take israeli minister foreign affair gideon saar refer understand eu provide detail implementation ask improvement agreement jordanian minister foreign affair expatriate ayman safadi tell reporter situation gaza remain catastrophic real catastrophe happen gaza result continuation israeli siege say meanwhile stutter ceasefire talk enter week monday mediator seek close gap israel hamas indirect negotiation qatar appear still remain deadlock side blame block deal release captive day ceasefire official knowledge talk say ongoing doha monday afp news agency report discussion currently focus propose map deployment israeli force within gaza source reportedly say mediator actively explore innovative mechanism bridge remain gap maintain momentum negotiation source add condition anonymity hamas accuse israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu say want see palestinian group destroy main obstacle netanyahu skill sabotage one round negotiation another unwilling reach agreement group write telegram netanyahu grow pressure end war military casualty rise public frustration mount also face backlash feasibility ethic plan build call humanitarian city scratch ruin southern gaza rafah house palestinian ceasefire take hold israel security establishment report unhappy plan unite nation agency palestinian refugee unrwa say amount plan concentration camp"
"Church leaders, diplomats, condemn Israeli settler violence in West Bank","Delegates from more than 20 countries visited the town of Taybeh after several attacks by Israeli settlers.","Published On 14 Jul 202514 Jul 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/14/church-leaders-diplomats-condemn-israeli-settler-violence-in-west-bank","tag/israel-palestine-conflict/","Top church leaders and diplomats have called on Israeli settlers to be held accountable during a visit to the predominantly Christian town of Taybeh in the occupied West Bank, after settlers intensified attacks on the area in recent weeks. Representatives from more than 20 countries including the United Kingdom, Russia, China, Japan, Jordan, and the European Union, were among the delegates who visited the village in the West Bank on Monday. Speaking in Taybeh, Greek Orthodox Patriarch Theophilos III and Latin Patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa denounced an incident last week when settlers set fires near the community’s church. They said that Israeli authorities failed to respond to emergency calls for help from the Palestinian community. In a separate statement, the patriarchs and heads of churches in Jerusalem demanded an investigation into the incident and called for the settlers to be held accountable by the Israeli authorities, “who facilitate and enable their presence around Taybeh”. The church leaders also said that settlers had brought their cattle to graze on Palestinian lands in the area, set fire to several homes last month, and put up a sign reading “there is no future for you here”.  Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim, reporting from Doha, said church leaders have been calling this a “systemic and targeted attack” against Christians. “About 50,000 of them live in the occupied West Bank, a small but very proud minority,” Ibrahim said. “They also consider themselves under attack, not just because they’re Christians but because they’re Palestinians.” The church has been trying for years to “enhance the steadfastness of the Christian community in Palestine”, Ibrahim said. “We’ve been seeing how Israeli settlers have been pushing them out of their lands, out of their homes.” Settlers, who are often armed, are backed by Israeli army soldiers and regularly carry out attacks against Palestinians, their lands, and property. Several rights groups have documented repeated instances where Israeli settlers in the West Bank ransack Palestinian neighbourhoods and towns, burning homes and vehicles. Assaults have grown in scale and intensity since Israel’s brutal war on Gaza began in October 2023. These assaults also include large-scale incursions by Israeli forces into Palestinian towns and cities across the West Bank that have killed hundreds of Palestinians and displaced tens of thousands. Pizzaballa, the top Catholic cleric in Jerusalem, said he believed the West Bank was becoming a lawless area. “The only law [in the West Bank] is that of power, of those who have the force, not the law. We must work for the law to return to this part of the country, so anyone can appeal to the law to enforce their rights,” Pizzaballa told reporters. He and Theophilos prayed together at the Church of St George, whose religious site dates back centuries, adjacent to the area where settlers ignited the fires.    The visit comes as Palestinians report a new surge of settler violence. On Monday, Israeli settlers and soldiers launched several more attacks across the West Bank, including in Bethlehem, where settlers uprooted hundreds of olive trees in al-Maniya village, southeast of the city, and Israeli authorities demolished a four-storey residential building. The head of the al-Maniya village council, Zayed Kawazba, told Wafa news agency that a group of settlers stormed al-Qarn in the centre of al-Maniya, set up four tents and uprooted approximately 1,500 olive saplings belonging to families from the al-Motawer and Jabarin clans. A day earlier, hundreds descended on the village of Al-Mazraa ash-Sharqiya, south of Taybeh, for the funeral of two young men killed during a settler attack on Friday. The occupied West Bank is home to more than three million Palestinians who live under harsh Israeli military rule, with the Palestinian Authority governing in limited areas separated from each other by a myriad of Israeli checkpoints. Israel has so far built more than 100 settlements across the West Bank, which are home to about 500,000 settlers who live illegally on private Palestinian land.","top church leader diplomat call israeli settler hold accountable visit predominantly christian town taybeh occupy west bank settler intensify attack area recent week representative country include unite kingdom russia china japan jordan european union among delegate visit village west bank monday speak taybeh greek orthodox patriarch theophilos iii latin patriarch pierbattista pizzaballa denounce incident last week settler set fire near community church say israeli authority fail respond emergency call help palestinian community separate statement patriarch head church jerusalem demand investigation incident call settler hold accountable israeli authority facilitate enable presence around taybeh church leader also say settler bring cattle graze palestinian land area set fire several home last month put sign read future al jazeera nida ibrahim report doha say church leader call systemic target attack christian live occupy west bank small proud minority ibrahim say also consider attack just re christian re palestinian church try year enhance steadfastness christian community palestine ibrahim say have see israeli settler push land home settler often arm back israeli army soldier regularly carry attack palestinian land property several right group document repeat instance israeli settler west bank ransack palestinian neighbourhood town burn home vehicle assault grow scale intensity since israel brutal war gaza begin october assault also include large scale incursion israeli force palestinian town city across west bank kill hundred palestinian displace ten thousand pizzaballa top catholic cleric jerusalem say believe west bank become lawless area law west bank power force law must work law return part country anyone can appeal law enforce right pizzaballa tell reporter theophilos pray together church st george whose religious site date back century adjacent area settler ignite fire visit come palestinian report new surge settler violence monday israeli settler soldier launch several attack across west bank include bethlehem settler uproot hundred olive tree al maniya village southeast city israeli authority demolish four storey residential build head al maniya village council zayed kawazba tell wafa news agency group settler storm al qarn centre al maniya set four tent uproot approximately olive sapling belong family al motawer jabarin clan day early hundred descend village al mazraa ash sharqiya south taybeh funeral two young man kill settler attack friday occupy west bank home three million palestinian live harsh israeli military rule palestinian authority govern limit area separate myriad israeli checkpoint israel far build settlement across west bank home settler live illegally private palestinian land"

Israel’s ongoing genocidal war has brought about scholasticide—a systematic and deliberate attempt to eliminate our universities, their infrastructure, faculty, and students. This destruction is not collateral; it is part of a targeted effort to eradicate the foundations of higher education in Gaza—foundations that have long stood as pillars of resilience, hope, and intellectual freedom under conditions of occupation and siege. While academic institutions across Palestine have faced attacks for decades, what we are witnessing today is an escalation: a shift from repeated acts of destruction to an attempt at total annihilation.     Yet, we remain resolute. For more than a year, we have mobilised and taken steps to resist this assault and ensure that our universities endure. Despite the physical obliteration of campuses, laboratories, libraries, and other facilities, and the assassination of our students and colleagues, our universities continue to exist. We are more than buildings — we are academic communities, comprised of students, faculty, and staff, still alive and determined to carry forward our mission. As articulated in the Unified Emergency Statement from Palestinian Academics and Administrators issued on May 29, 2024, “Israeli occupation forces have demolished our buildings, but our universities live on.” For over a year, our faculty, staff and students have persisted in our core mission — teaching — under unimaginably harsh conditions. Constant bombardment, starvation, restrictions on internet access, unstable electricity, and the ongoing horrors of genocide have not broken our will. We are still here, still teaching, and still committed to the future of education in Gaza. We urgently call on our colleagues around the world to work for: We appeal to the international academic community — our colleagues, institutions, and friends — to: Last year, we formally established the Emergency Committee of Universities in Gaza, representing our three institutions and affiliated colleges — together enrolling between 80 and 85 percent of Gaza universities’ students. The committee exists to resist the erasure of our universities and offer a unified voice for Gaza’s academic community. It has since established subject-focused subcommittees to serve as trusted and coordinated channels for support. We call upon academic communities around the world to coordinate themselves in response to this call. The time for symbolic solidarity has passed. We now ask for practical, structured, and enduring partnership. Work alongside us to ensure that Gaza’s universities live on and remain a vital part of our collective future.

Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim, reporting from Doha, said church leaders have been calling this a “systemic and targeted attack” against Christians. “About 50,000 of them live in the occupied West Bank, a small but very proud minority,” Ibrahim said. “They also consider themselves under attack, not just because they’re Christians but because they’re Palestinians.” The church has been trying for years to “enhance the steadfastness of the Christian community in Palestine”, Ibrahim said. “We’ve been seeing how Israeli settlers have been pushing them out of their lands, out of their homes.” Settlers, who are often armed, are backed by Israeli army soldiers and regularly carry out attacks against Palestinians, their lands, and property. Several rights groups have documented repeated instances where Israeli settlers in the West Bank ransack Palestinian neighbourhoods and towns, burning homes and vehicles. Assaults have grown in scale and intensity since Israel’s brutal war on Gaza began in October 2023. These assaults also include large-scale incursions by Israeli forces into Palestinian towns and cities across the West Bank that have killed hundreds of Palestinians and displaced tens of thousands. Pizzaballa, the top Catholic cleric in Jerusalem, said he believed the West Bank was becoming a lawless area. “The only law [in the West Bank] is that of power, of those who have the force, not the law. We must work for the law to return to this part of the country, so anyone can appeal to the law to enforce their rights,” Pizzaballa told reporters. He and Theophilos prayed together at the Church of St George, whose religious site dates back centuries, adjacent to the area where settlers ignited the fires.    The visit comes as Palestinians report a new surge of settler violence. On Monday, Israeli settlers and soldiers launched several more attacks across the West Bank, including in Bethlehem, where settlers uprooted hundreds of olive trees in al-Maniya village, southeast of the city, and Israeli authorities demolished a four-storey residential building. The head of the al-Maniya village council, Zayed Kawazba, told Wafa news agency that a group of settlers stormed al-Qarn in the centre of al-Maniya, set up four tents and uprooted approximately 1,500 olive saplings belonging to families from the al-Motawer and Jabarin clans. A day earlier, hundreds descended on the village of Al-Mazraa ash-Sharqiya, south of Taybeh, for the funeral of two young men killed during a settler attack on Friday. The occupied West Bank is home to more than three million Palestinians who live under harsh Israeli military rule, with the Palestinian Authority governing in limited areas separated from each other by a myriad of Israeli checkpoints. Israel has so far built more than 100 settlements across the West Bank, which are home to about 500,000 settlers who live illegally on private Palestinian land.","top church leader diplomat call israeli settler hold accountable visit predominantly christian town taybeh occupy west bank settler intensify attack area recent week representative country include unite kingdom russia china japan jordan european union among delegate visit village west bank monday speak taybeh greek orthodox patriarch theophilos iii latin patriarch pierbattista pizzaballa denounce incident last week settler set fire near community church say israeli authority fail respond emergency call help palestinian community separate statement patriarch head church jerusalem demand investigation incident call settler hold accountable israeli authority facilitate enable presence around taybeh church leader also say settler bring cattle graze palestinian land area set fire several home last month put sign read future al jazeera nida ibrahim report doha say church leader call systemic target attack christian live occupy west bank small proud minority ibrahim say also consider attack just re christian re palestinian church try year enhance steadfastness christian community palestine ibrahim say have see israeli settler push land home settler often arm back israeli army soldier regularly carry attack palestinian land property several right group document repeat instance israeli settler west bank ransack palestinian neighbourhood town burn home vehicle assault grow scale intensity since israel brutal war gaza begin october assault also include large scale incursion israeli force palestinian town city across west bank kill hundred palestinian displace ten thousand pizzaballa top catholic cleric jerusalem say believe west bank become lawless area law west bank power force law must work law return part country anyone can appeal law enforce right pizzaballa tell reporter theophilos pray together church st george whose religious site date back century adjacent area settler ignite fire visit come palestinian report new surge settler violence monday israeli settler soldier launch several attack across west bank include bethlehem settler uproot hundred olive tree al maniya village southeast city israeli authority demolish four storey residential build head al maniya village council zayed kawazba tell wafa news agency group settler storm al qarn centre al maniya set four tent uproot approximately olive sapling belong family al motawer jabarin clan day early hundred descend village al mazraa ash sharqiya south taybeh funeral two young man kill settler attack friday occupy west bank home three million palestinian live harsh israeli military rule palestinian authority govern limit area separate myriad israeli checkpoint israel far build settlement across west bank home settler live illegally private palestinian land"
"An open letter from the presidents of Gaza universities","Our campuses may have been razed, but our universities continue to exist.","Opinion by Ayman Sobh and Omar Milad and Asad AsaadAyman Sobh|Omar Milad|Asad AsaadPublished On 14 Jul 202514 Jul 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/14/an-open-letter-from-the-presidents-of-gaza-universities","tag/israel-palestine-conflict/","We, the presidents of Gaza’s three non-profit universities— Al-Aqsa University, Al-Azhar University-Gaza, and the Islamic University of Gaza — together accounting for the vast majority of Gaza’s students and faculty members, issue this unified statement to the international academic community at a time of unprecedented devastation of higher education in Gaza. Israel’s ongoing genocidal war has brought about scholasticide—a systematic and deliberate attempt to eliminate our universities, their infrastructure, faculty, and students. This destruction is not collateral; it is part of a targeted effort to eradicate the foundations of higher education in Gaza—foundations that have long stood as pillars of resilience, hope, and intellectual freedom under conditions of occupation and siege. While academic institutions across Palestine have faced attacks for decades, what we are witnessing today is an escalation: a shift from repeated acts of destruction to an attempt at total annihilation.     Yet, we remain resolute. For more than a year, we have mobilised and taken steps to resist this assault and ensure that our universities endure. Despite the physical obliteration of campuses, laboratories, libraries, and other facilities, and the assassination of our students and colleagues, our universities continue to exist. We are more than buildings — we are academic communities, comprised of students, faculty, and staff, still alive and determined to carry forward our mission. As articulated in the Unified Emergency Statement from Palestinian Academics and Administrators issued on May 29, 2024, “Israeli occupation forces have demolished our buildings, but our universities live on.” For over a year, our faculty, staff and students have persisted in our core mission — teaching — under unimaginably harsh conditions. Constant bombardment, starvation, restrictions on internet access, unstable electricity, and the ongoing horrors of genocide have not broken our will. We are still here, still teaching, and still committed to the future of education in Gaza. We urgently call on our colleagues around the world to work for: We appeal to the international academic community — our colleagues, institutions, and friends — to: Last year, we formally established the Emergency Committee of Universities in Gaza, representing our three institutions and affiliated colleges — together enrolling between 80 and 85 percent of Gaza universities’ students. The committee exists to resist the erasure of our universities and offer a unified voice for Gaza’s academic community. It has since established subject-focused subcommittees to serve as trusted and coordinated channels for support. We call upon academic communities around the world to coordinate themselves in response to this call. The time for symbolic solidarity has passed. We now ask for practical, structured, and enduring partnership. Work alongside us to ensure that Gaza’s universities live on and remain a vital part of our collective future.

"Chelsea trounce PSG to lift FIFA Club World Cup","English Premier League side Chelsea beat European champions Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in FIFA’s club showpiece final.","Published On 13 Jul 202513 Jul 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/13/chelsea-trounce-psg-to-lift-fifa-club-world-cup","sports/","Cole Palmer scored twice and fed Joao Pedro for a goal as Chelsea overwhelmed Paris Saint-Germain in the first half and beat the European champions 3-0 in the final of the first expanded FIFA Club World Cup. Palmer had almost identical left-footed goals from just inside the penalty area in the 22nd and 30th minutes on Saturday, and then sent a through pass that enabled Pedro to chip goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma in the 43rd for his third goal in two starts with the Blues. “It’s a great feeling. Even better, because everyone doubted us before the game. We knew we had to put up a fight against a great team,” player of the match Palmer said afterwards. A 23-year-old who joined Chelsea from Manchester City two years ago, Palmer scored 18 goals this season. PSG finished a man short after Joao Neves was given a red card in the 84th minute for pulling down Marc Cucurella by his hair. After a testy final few minutes, the teams needed to be separated as PSG coach Luis Enrique and Donnarumma pushed Pedro near the centre circle. A heavy favourite who had outscored opponents 16-1, PSG had been looking to complete a quadruple after winning Ligue 1, the Coupe de France and its first Champions League title. Before a tournament-high crowd of 81,188 at MetLife Stadium, which included United States President Donald Trump, Chelsea showed the energy of a fourth day of rest after its semifinal, one more than PSG. Chelsea had finished fourth in the Premier League and won the third-tier UEFA Conference League. The Blues took the world title for the second time after 2021, when it was a seven-team event. The Blues earned $128.4m to $153.8m in prize money, the amount depending on a participation fee FIFA has not disclosed. PSG had not lost by three goals since a 4-1 Champions League defeat at Newcastle in October 2023. Chelsea went ahead in the 22nd after goalkeeper Robert Sanchez kicked the ball downfield and Nuno Mendes mis-hit his header 15 yards past the midfield stripe towards his own goal. Malo Gusto’s shot was blocked by Lucas Beraldo, and rebounded to Palmer, who ended PSG’s streak of 436 minutes without conceding. Palmer doubled the lead in the 30th when he ran onto a long ball from Levi Colwill, and cut inside before shooting. Chelsea heads into the 2025-26 season, which starts in less than five weeks, believing it can challenge Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal for the Premier League title.","cole palmer score twice feed joao pedro goal chelsea overwhelm paris saint germain first half beat european champion final first expand fifa club world cup palmer almost identical leave foot goal just inside penalty area nd th minute saturday send pass enable pedro chip goalkeeper gianluigi donnarumma rd goal two start blue great feel even good everyone doubt us game know put fight great team player match palmer say afterwards year old join chelsea manchester city two year ago palmer score goal season psg finish man short joao neves give red card th minute pull marc cucurella hair testy final minute team need separate psg coach luis enrique donnarumma push pedro near centre circle heavy favourite outscored opponent psg look complete quadruple win ligue coupe de france first champion league title tournament high crowd metlife stadium include unite state president donald trump chelsea show energy day rest semifinal one psg chelsea finish premier league win tier uefa conference league blue take world title time seven team event blue earn be be prize money amount depend participation fee fifa disclose psg lose three goal since champion league defeat newcastle october chelsea go ahead nd goalkeeper robert sanchez kick ball downfield nuno mendes mis hit header yard past midfield stripe towards goal malo gusto shoot block lucas beraldo rebound palmer end psg streak minute without concede palmer double lead th run onto long ball levi colwill cut inside shoot chelsea head season start little five week believe can challenge liverpool manchester city arsenal premier league title"
"Revenge is served as Sinner outclasses Alcaraz to win Wimbledon","Top seed Sinner defeats Alcaraz 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 in the final to win his first Wimbledon and fourth Grand Slam title.","Published On 13 Jul 202513 Jul 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/13/sinner-beats-alcaraz-to-win-wimbledon-2025-grand-slam-title","sports/","Wimbledon, United Kingdom – It has taken Jannik Sinner just five weeks to exact revenge against Carlos Alcaraz in their blockbuster tennis rivalry and win the men’s singles final at Wimbledon 2025. The top-seeded Italian overcame the emotional and physical toll of losing the French Open final to Alcaraz by defeating the Spaniard 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in London on Sunday. Sinner turned the tables on the defending champion by overcoming a loss in the first set – and some early nerves – to win his fourth Grand Slam trophy and first on the famous Centre Court at SW19. Two-time champion Alcaraz began the final with a strong service game, pouncing on Sinner’s nervous start in his first appearance in a Wimbledon final. The 22-year-old went on to break the world number one’s serve and wrap up the first set in 45 minutes, deploying a serve-and-volley style strategy to win the crucial points. Sinner dug deep in the second set and was back to his ice-cool self as he applied the brakes on Alcaraz’s attempt for a three-peat of titles at Wimbledon. The quality of tennis went up a notch as the 23-year-old matched Alcaraz shot for shot and left the crowd gasping at every other point. Sinner didn’t waste much time in breaking back against the defending champion by deploying an excellent service game to keep Alcaraz at bay, altering his speed and delivery to ensure his opponent scurried for every point. He was soon on level terms. The third set was, by far, the highlight of the final as both players threw everything at each other with sensational court coverage, scintillating aces, sublime drop shots and even a “tweener”. It was end-to-end action up until the eighth game, when Alcaraz slipped up by the barest of margins but ended up having his serve broken. Sinner wasted no time to bring out his ruthless streak and finish off Alcaraz’s chances in the set. Leading the final two sets to one, Sinner stepped on the gas in the fourth and ensured there would be no late Alcaraz comeback as so memorably occurred in the French Open final on June 8. He broke Alcaraz in the third game, and the stoic Italian showed a glimpse of emotion as he looked towards his team in the stands. Crowd favourite Alcaraz had most of the capacity crowd on Centre Court behind him, including King Felipe of Spain, but it was not enough to help him stay in the final for one more set as Sinner sealed the trophy with a faultless service game. With joy and disbelief etched on his face, and with the match now over, Sinner raised both arms with a jolt before squatting down on the court to pat the grass with the other hand, all the while hiding the emotions on his face. Not only did he avenge his French Open final loss with a fourth major trophy, Sinner also moved to within one Grand Slam title of his great contemporary Alcaraz. The two-time Australian Open champion has become the first man from Italy to win the Wimbledon title, a feat he described as akin to “a dream of a dream”. “I had never thought of being in this position [to win Wimbledon] growing up so far away from here,” an unusually emotional Sinner said on court after the match. “I had a very tough loss in Paris, but I tried to understand what I did wrong and kept working [hard].” Sinner has now won Grand Slam titles on two of the three surfaces and said he was happy to have held his nerve while serving for the championship in the fourth set. Alcaraz, ever the gracious opponent in defeat as in victory, kept up his applause for Sinner even after returning to his chair after losing the match. But he said it was a difficult loss. “I love playing here and I’m going to be back for sure,” the Spaniard told his fans on Centre Court. Both players walked off to a loud round of applause after providing yet another enthralling glimpse into another “golden era” of tennis. Sinner and Alcaraz have won all seven Grand Slam finals since the beginning of 2024, and it will only be a matter of eight weeks until tennis fans can hope to see the next instalment of their flourishing rivalry at the last Grand Slam of the year, the US Open.","wimbledon unite kingdom take jannik sinner just five week exact revenge carlos alcaraz blockbuster tennis rivalry win man single final wimbledon top seed italian overcome emotional physical toll lose french open final alcaraz defeat spaniard england lawn tennis croquet club london sunday sinner turn table defend champion overcome loss first set early nerve win grand slam trophy first famous centre court sw two time champion alcaraz begin final strong service game pounce sinner nervous start first appearance wimbledon final year old go break world numb one serve wrap first set minute deploy serve volley style strategy win crucial point sinner dig deep set back ice cool self apply brake alcaraz attempt three peat title wimbledon quality tennis go notch year old match alcaraz shoot shoot leave crowd gasp every point sinner didn waste much time break back defend champion deploy excellent service game keep alcaraz bay alter speed delivery ensure opponent scurry every point soon level term set far highlight final player throw everything sensational court coverage scintillate ace sublime drop shot even tweener end end action game alcaraz slip bare margin end serve break sinner waste time bring ruthless streak finish alcaraz chance set lead final two set one sinner step gas ensure late alcaraz comeback memorably occur french open final june break alcaraz game stoic italian show glimpse emotion look towards team stand crowd favourite alcaraz capacity crowd centre court behind include king felipe spain enough help stay final one set sinner seal trophy faultless service game joy disbelief etch face match now sinner raise arm jolt squat court pat grass hand hide emotion face avenge french open final loss major trophy sinner also move within one grand slam title great contemporary alcaraz two time australian open champion become first man italy win wimbledon title feat describe akin dream dream never think position win wimbledon grow far away unusually emotional sinner say court match tough loss paris try understand wrong keep work hard sinner now win grand slam title two three surface say happy hold nerve serve championship set alcaraz ever gracious opponent defeat victory keep applause sinner even return chair lose match say difficult loss love play be go back sure spaniard tell fan centre court player walk loud round applause provide yet another enthrall glimpse another golden era tennis sinner alcaraz win seven grand slam final since begin matter eight week tennis fan can hope see next instalment flourish rivalry last grand slam year us open"

"Marquez reigns supreme to win German MotoGP after only 10 riders finish","Marc Marquez stages a lights-to-flag victory to record his ninth German MotoGP victory as podium contenders crash out.","Published On 13 Jul 202513 Jul 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/13/marc-marquez-wins-chaotic-german-motogp-at-sachsenring","sports/","Marc Marquez proved once again why he is known as the “King of Sachsenring” when the Ducati rider marked his 200th MotoGP start by winning the German Grand Prix in a race that became a test of survival after only 10 of 18 riders finished. Marquez’s ninth MotoGP victory at the Sachsenring stretched his championship lead over brother Alex, who finished second, to 83 points while Marc’s teammate Francesco Bagnaia finished third to sit 147 points behind.     Alex Marquez had started fifth on the grid and took second in his 100th MotoGP start despite still recovering from a fractured hand he suffered at the Dutch Grand Prix two weeks ago, which required surgery. Several riders crashed over the course of the race, especially at turn one – including VR46 Racing’s Fabio Di Giannantonio and Aprilia’s Marco Bezzecchi when they were in second place. But the day belonged to Marc Marquez as he marked his latest triumph at his favourite hunting ground by standing on his bike and doing a jig as he passed the chequered flag – a fourth straight weekend where he had won both the sprint and the race. “One more [win at the Sachsenring] was super special. From the beginning, I felt good, the confidence when I started the weekend was super high because we were coming from three victories in a row,” he said. “We are in an incredible moment. Now we can say that half the season is done. Now [the second] half we still need to be super concentrated.” Pedro Acosta became the third rider to crash early on after Lorenzo Savadori and Miguel Oliveira, with the young Spaniard gesturing at his fallen machine in frustration. Di Giannantonio had broken the lap record in Friday’s practice and given Marc Marquez a tough time early in the sprint race on Saturday. But the Italian was unable to push any harder to catch up to Marquez, who found a comfortable rhythm and pace to surge more than two seconds ahead despite easing off the throttle on two laps to conserve his tyres. As Marquez’s lead stretched to more than three seconds, Di Giannantonio’s challenge came to an end on the downhill braking zone on turn one when he lost control and crashed, with his bike tumbling across the gravel while he escaped unhurt. LCR Honda’s Johann Zarco, who started second on the grid before getting pushed down the order, crashed at the same turn seconds later. Bezzecchi had moved up to second, but the Aprilia rider also bit the dust on the very next lap at turn one, moving Alex Marquez up to second while Bagnaia suddenly found himself in the podium positions. The crashes did not end there as Trackhouse Racing’s Ai Ogura lost his balance on turn one and ended up taking out Honda’s Joan Mir in the process, leaving only 10 of the 18 starters. Yamaha’s Fabio Quartararo finished fourth ahead of Alex Marquez’s Gresini Racing teammate Fermin Aldeguer.","marc marquez prove know king sachsenring ducati rider mark th motogp start win german grand prix race become test survival rider finish marquez motogp victory sachsenring stretch championship lead brother alex finish point marc teammate francesco bagnaia finish sit point behind alex marquez start grid take th motogp start despite still recover fracture hand suffer dutch grand prix two week ago require surgery several rider crash course race especially turn one include vr race fabio di giannantonio aprilia marco bezzecchi place day belong marc marquez mark late triumph favourite hunt grind stand bike jig pass chequer flag straight weekend win sprint race one win sachsenring super special begin feel good confidence start weekend super high come three victory row say incredible moment now can say half season do now half still need super concentrate pedro acosta become rider crash early lorenzo savadori miguel oliveira young spaniard gesture fall machine frustration di giannantonio break lap record friday practice give marc marquez tough time early sprint race saturday italian unable push hard catch marquez find comfortable rhythm pace surge two second ahead despite ease throttle two lap conserve tyre marquez lead stretch three second di giannantonio challenge come end downhill brake zone turn one lose control crash bike tumble across gravel escape unhurt lcr honda johann zarco start grid get push order crash turn second late bezzecchi move aprilia rider also bite dust next lap turn one move alex marquez bagnaia suddenly find podium position crash end trackhouse race ai ogura lose balance turn one end take honda joan mir process leave starter yamaha fabio quartararo finish ahead alex marquez gresini race teammate fermin aldeguer"

The 38-year-old’s brace on Saturday helped Inter Miami (11-3-5, 38 points) snap a club-record 15-game unbeaten streak across all competitions for Nashville (12-5-5, 41 points), which lost for the first time since April 19 at Seattle. Messi scored two or more goals for the fifth consecutive time in an MLS match, which is a league record. Inter Miami improved to 4-0-1 in its last five matches with Nashville while also winning their fifth consecutive MLS match overall. Miami has won three in a row since it was eliminated by Paris Saint-Germain in the round of 16 at the FIFA Club World Cup on June 29. Messi capitalised on a major mistake by Nashville goalkeeper Joe Willis to strike for what turned out to be the match-winning goal in the 62nd minute. Willis chested a ball and tried to clear it out of his zone but kicked it right in Messi’s direction. Messi intercepted it with his left foot, then worked the ball around Willis and fired it home to put Miami ahead for good. The goal came 13 minutes after Nashville’s Hany Mukhtar tied the game at 1-1 with a perfectly timed header off a pinpoint cross from distance by Andy Najar. It was Mukhtar’s 10th goal of the season. Patrick Yazbek also had an assist. Messi’s first goal came in the 17th minute on another spectacular free-kick score. Messi fired a ball precisely through a gap in the wall set up by Nashville’s defenders, and it found the mark just out of the reach of a diving Willis. Messi with his 16 goals this season is tied for the most in the league with Nashville’s Sam Surridge, who was kept off the scoresheet on Saturday. Messi has 23 goal contributions in MLS games this season and has 22 goals across all competitions. Each side returns to action on Wednesday as Inter Miami will play at Cincinnati and Nashville will host Columbus.","lionel messi extend ml record score streak two goal make difference victory host inter miami nashville sc fort lauderdale florida year old brace saturday help inter miami point snap club record game unbeaten streak across competition nashville point lose first time since april seattle messi score two goal consecutive time ml match league record inter miami improve last five match nashville also win consecutive ml match overall miami win three row since eliminate paris saint germain round fifa club world cup june messi capitalise major mistake nashville goalkeeper joe willis strike turn match win goal nd minute willis chested ball try clear zone kick right messi direction messi intercept leave foot work ball around willis fire home put miami ahead good goal come minute nashville hany mukhtar tie game perfectly time header pinpoint cross distance andy najar mukhtar th goal season patrick yazbek also assist messi first goal come th minute another spectacular free kick score messi fire ball precisely gap wall set nashville defender find mark just reach dive willis messi goal season tie league nashville sam surridge keep scoresheet saturday messi goal contribution ml game season goal across competition side return action wednesday inter miami play cincinnati nashville host columbus"
"‘Fire vs ice’: Is Alcaraz vs Sinner the next big tennis rivalry?","Ahead of their Wimbledon final, fans and legends predict the players to light up the tennis world in years to come.","Published On 12 Jul 202512 Jul 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/12/alcaraz-vs-sinner-tennis-champions-set-to-resume-rivalry-at-wimbledon-2025","sports/","Wimbledon, United Kingdom – Expectations will run high, and so will the temperatures in southwest London, when Carlos Alcaraz steps on Centre Court to defend his Wimbledon title against Jannik Sinner on Sunday. The next instalment of an enthralling rivalry between the top two players in men’s tennis will come under the limelight once again at one of the biggest stages in the game – the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club – on a hot afternoon in the United Kingdom’s capital. Two-time Wimbledon champion Alcaraz expects to be pushed to the limit by world number one Sinner in a meeting that has already drawn comparisons with the great Wimbledon finals of the modern era. “I expect to be on the limit, to be on the line [in the final],” Alcaraz said while speaking to the media moments after Sinner’s near-faultless semifinal 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win over Novak Djokovic on Friday. A few hours earlier, the Spaniard had booked a spot in his third consecutive Wimbledon final with a resilient performance against Taylor Fritz, which brought him a 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6 (8-6) win. It will be the 13th on-court meeting between the two, and their second Grand Slam final in the space of five weeks. Their duel in the French Open final lasted five hours and 29 minutes and added fuel to the fiery-yet-friendly rivalry between the young tennis stars. 🚨 THE REMATCH IS HAPPENING 🚨@janniksin will face @carlosalcaraz in the Wimbledon final on Sunday!@Wimbledon | #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/JedFZHXoZL — ATP Tour (@atptour) July 11, 2025  Alcaraz knows his opponent all too well and expects nothing short of another spectacle. “Whatever Jannik has is because he has learned from everything – he just gets better after every match, every day,” Alcaraz said of the top seed. The Spaniard said he expected Sinner to be in better shape mentally and physically for the Wimbledon final, but that he was not looking forward to another hours-long match. “I just hope not to be five and a half hours on court again. But if I have to, I will.” Meanwhile, Sinner – the tall, stoic and speedy Italian who stands between Alcaraz and a chance to become only the fifth man to win three straight Wimbledon titles – believes beating the holder will be “very tough”. “I’m very happy to share the court with Carlos once again. It’s going to be difficult, I know that,” Sinner said on Friday. The Australian Open champion said he loves playing Grand Slam finals – Sunday’s will be his fifth in two years. “I always try to put myself in these kinds of situations that I really love. Sundays at every tournament are very special.” The 23-year-old from northern Italy termed Alcaraz as the favourite, given his record at the tournament and on grass courts. “He is the favourite. He won here the last two times. He’s again in the final. It’s very tough to beat him on grass, but I like these challenges.” Out of the 12 occasions that both players have met, four have been at Grand Slams, but this is only their second meeting in the final. The pair’s only other meeting at Wimbledon came in the fourth round in 2022, when Sinner won 6-1, 6-4, 6-7 (6-8), 6-3. Alcaraz, however, brushed aside the reference by saying that both men are changed players from what they were three years ago. “We’re completely different players on grass and on all surfaces.” The 22-year-old from Murcia, in southeastern Spain, will be buoyed by his 5-0 record against Sinner in the past two years. Despite Alcaraz’s success against his nemesis, it is Sinner who has consistently topped the men’s rankings by racking up regular wins and points on the ATP circuit. All things considered, there is not much that separates the two ahead of their highly anticipated match. Just ask Djokovic. While the 24-time Grand Slam champion picked Alcaraz due to his past success at Wimbledon, Djokovic predicted “a very close match-up, like they had in Paris” when asked to choose a winner. “I think I will give a slight edge to Carlos because of the two titles he’s won here and the way he’s playing and the confidence he has right now, but it’s just a slight advantage, because Jannik is hitting the ball extremely well.” It is not just their contrasting styles of play – Sinner relies on his baseline game and shot speed, while Alcaraz likes to cover the court with his nimble footwork and excellent coverage – but also their on-court personalities that set the two apart while making them an engaging pair to watch. Before the French Open final, Alcaraz said in an interview that a “fire vs ice” analogy fits them perfectly. “I guess you can say I am like fire because of the way I react on court and show emotions, while Jannik remains calm,” the Spaniard said with his trademark smile. For the fans, though, the pair offer another chance to pick sides and look forward to tennis tournaments that could pit the two against each other. “It’s a dream final,” Catherine Shaw, a tennis fan who watched both the men’s semifinals on Centre Court, told Al Jazeera. “They are the next big thing when it comes to tennis rivalries, so it’s exciting times for tennis fans.” Stepping out in the shadows of some of the greatest players and rivals – Stefan Edberg vs Ivan Lendl, Bjorn Borg vs John McEnroe, Andre Agassi vs Pete Sampras and Rafael Nadal vs Roger Federer – the young players will have big shoes to fill. Both are aware of the weight their match-up carries but refuse to be compared with their heroes just yet. “I think the things that we are doing right now are great for tennis,” Alcaraz said ahead of the final. “We just fight to engage more people to watch tennis. We’re fighting for tennis to be bigger, as all the tennis players are doing. “For me, it’s sharing the big tournaments with Jannik, or just playing in the finals of the tournaments… We’re still really young. “I hope to keep doing the right things for the next five to 10 years, so our rivalry is on the same table as those players.”","wimbledon unite kingdom expectation run high temperature southwest london carlos alcaraz step centre court defend wimbledon title jannik sinner sunday next instalment enthrall rivalry top two player man tennis come limelight one big stage game england lawn tennis croquet club hot afternoon unite kingdom capital two time wimbledon champion alcaraz expect push limit world numb one sinner meet already draw comparison great wimbledon final modern era expect limit line final alcaraz say speak medium moment sinner near faultless semifinal win novak djokovic friday hour early spaniard book spot consecutive wimbledon final resilient performance taylor fritz bring win th court meet two grand slam final space five week duel french open final last five hour minute add fuel fiery yet friendly rivalry young tennis star rematch happen janniksin face carlosalcaraz wimbledon final sunday wimbledon wimbledon pic twitter com jedfzhxozl atp tour atptour july alcaraz know opponent good expect nothing short another spectacle whatever jannik learn everything just get good every match every day alcaraz say top seed spaniard say expect sinner good shape mentally physically wimbledon final look forward another hour long match just hope five half hour court meanwhile sinner tall stoic speedy italian stand alcaraz chance become man win three straight wimbledon title believe beat holder tough be happy share court carlos go difficult know sinner say friday australian open champion say love play grand slam final sunday two year always try put kind situation really love sunday every tournament special year old northern italy term alcaraz favourite give record tournament grass court favourite win last two time final tough beat grass like challenge occasion player meet four grand slam meet final pair meet wimbledon come round sinner win alcaraz however brush aside reference say man change player three year ago re completely different player grass surface year old murcia southeastern spain buoy record sinner past two year despite alcaraz success nemesis sinner consistently top man ranking rack regular win point atp circuit thing consider much separate two ahead highly anticipate match just ask djokovic time grand slam champion pick alcaraz due past success wimbledon djokovic predict close match like paris ask choose winner think give slight edge carlos two title win way play confidence right now just slight advantage jannik hit ball extremely good just contrast style play sinner rely baseline game shoot speed alcaraz like cover court nimble footwork excellent coverage also court personality set two apart make engage pair watch french open final alcaraz say interview fire vs ice analogy fit perfectly guess can say like fire way react court show emotion jannik remain calm spaniard say trademark smile fan though pair offer another chance pick side look forward tennis tournament pit two dream final catherine shaw tennis fan watch man semifinal centre court tell al jazeera next big thing come tennis rivalry excite time tennis fan step shadow great player rival stefan edberg vs ivan lendl bjorn borg vs john mcenroe andre agassi vs pete sampras rafael nadal vs roger federer young player big shoe fill aware weight match carry refuse compare hero just yet think thing right now great tennis alcaraz say ahead final just fight engage people watch tennis re fight tennis big tennis player share big tournament jannik just play final tournament re still really young hope keep right thing next five year rivalry table player"
"Infantino hails ‘golden era’ for club football before CWC final","On the eve of the FIFA Club World Cup final, the governing body’s president hails a ‘golden era’ for the club game.","Published On 12 Jul 202512 Jul 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/12/fifa-club-world-cup-infantino-hails-dawn-of-golden-era","sports/","FIFA President Gianni Infantino triumphantly declared the Club World Cup to be “the most successful club competition in the world” on Saturday before this weekend’s final between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea. The first 32-team edition of the tournament faced criticism in the build-up for stretching demands on elite players and has been played out in baking temperatures in the United States that have raised concerns for the health of those involved. There were also doubts about the level of interest the competition would generate among fans, but Infantino said he was satisfied with the attendance at matches, despite many games being far from sold out, and claimed it had been a major success financially. “The golden age of club football has started. We can definitely say this FIFA Club World Cup has been a huge success,” Infantino told reporters at Trump Tower on New York City’s Fifth Avenue, where FIFA has just opened an office. “We heard that financially it would not work, that nobody is interested, but I can say we generated almost $2.1bn in revenues, for 63 matches,” he said. “That makes an average of $33m per match – no other club competition in the world comes close. “It is already the most successful club competition in the world.” Former Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp has been one of the leading voices against the tournament, calling it “the worst idea ever implemented in football” in a recent interview. But the head of world football’s governing body dismissed suggestions that Klopp might be speaking for most observers in Europe. “We shouldn’t say that the opinion of Europe on this is very bad because it is not true,” said Infantino, who was appearing on a stage alongside numerous footballing greats, including the Brazilian Ronaldo. “All the teams who have come here have been happy – some teams who didn’t come here because they didn’t qualify were calling us to see how they could qualify. “Of course, I would have liked to have Liverpool here, Arsenal, Manchester United, Barcelona, Tottenham, AC Milan, Napoli … but you have to qualify and there are different criteria.” The next Club World Cup is due to take place in 2029, with Infantino refusing to commit when asked whether the tournament could be played every two years or be expanded to feature more teams. “We created something new, something which is here to stay, something which is changing the landscape of club football,” he added.","fifa president gianni infantino triumphantly declare club world cup successful club competition world saturday weekend final paris saint germain chelsea first team edition tournament face criticism build stretch demand elite player play bake temperature unite state raise concern health involve also doubt level interest competition generate among fan infantino say satisfy attendance match despite many game far sell claim major success financially golden age club football start can definitely say fifa club world cup huge success infantino tell reporter trump tower new york city avenue fifa just open office hear financially work nobody interest can say generate almost bn revenue match say make average be per match club competition world come close already successful club competition world former liverpool coach jurgen klopp one lead voice tournament call bad idea ever implement football recent interview head world football govern body dismiss suggestion klopp may speak observer europe shouldn say opinion europe bad true say infantino appear stage alongside numerous footballing great include brazilian ronaldo team come happy team didn come didn qualify call us see qualify course like liverpool arsenal manchester unite barcelona tottenham ac milan napoli qualify different criterion next club world cup due take place infantino refuse commit ask whether tournament play every two year expand feature team create something new something stay something change landscape club football add"
"India level up with England as tempers nearly boil over at Lord’s","India post 387 to match England’s first innings in the third Test but tempers flare before stumps on third day.","Published On 12 Jul 202512 Jul 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/12/india-level-up-with-england-as-tempers-nearly-boil-over-at-lords","sports/","KL Rahul scored a century while Ravindra Jadeja and Rishabh Pant pitched in with crucial fifties as India posted 387, equalling England’s first innings, on a heated third day on and off the field at Lord’s An injury to Shoaib Bashir blunted England’s pace-spin attack strategy when India looked vulnerable with five wickets down after losing Pant and Rahul in quick succession, before Jadeja steadied their innings with his third fifty-plus knock in a row.     England openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett, who played a single over from Jasprit Bumrah before stumps, remained unbeaten at 2-0 as the five-match series remains tied as both sides look to go 2-1 up with a win in the third Test. With two overs scheduled to be bowled before stumps, tempers started to flare when Crawley pulled out of his stance four times – and later in the over called for the physio in what would be the only over of England’s second innings. The tourists were irate with Mohammed Siraj displaying a thunderous look, before Bumrah slow handclapped and India skipper Shubman Gill confronted Crawley, pointing a finger in the opener’s face. India started well from an overnight score of 145-3 as left-handed batter Pant, who scored twin centuries in the first test, battled through an injured finger on his left hand as he hooked England captain Stokes for six to bring up his fifty. The 27-year-old survived when an awkward hook on a short ball from Stokes almost got him caught near the fine leg boundary, but a diving Crawley could only lob the ball back inside to prevent a six. But Pant was run out for 74 on the last ball before lunch as he tried to take a quick single after playing Bashir towards cover point, where Stokes made a quick turn to hit the stumps on the non-striker’s end with a swift, direct throw. Opener Rahul was the next to fall, edging Bashir’s flighted ball to Harry Brook in the slip on his very next ball after reaching 100, leaving India on shaky ground at 254-5 under a warm London sun. But Bashir had to leave the ground when he injured a finger on his non-bowling left hand while attempting a low catch from his own delivery as Jadeja shot down the wicket, with commentators saying the 21-year-old might need extra treatment in the evening. Jadeja and Nitish Kumar Reddy, new to the crease, looked unsteady as England’s bowlers piled on the pressure. Mix-ups between the batters put Reddy at risk of getting run out on two occasions, but Ollie Pope’s direct throws missed the target both times. However, as England returned to using two pacers soon after Bashir’s injury, the pair put together a 72-run partnership before Stokes claimed his second wicket of the match, getting Reddy to nick it to keeper Jamie Smith for 30. Jadeja drove Joe Root down long off for four to complete his half-century, while Washington Sundar took a slow, cautious approach on the other end. Their 50-run partnership for the eighth wicket got India within 11 runs of England’s total, before Chris Woakes dismissed Jadeja for 72 as the batter’s attempt to send the ball down fine leg only took a thin edge and landed in Smith’s gloves. Akash Deep, in at number nine, was given out leg before wicket twice by umpire Sharfuddoula Saikat during the same over, but Hawk-Eye showed the ball was missing the stumps when the batter reviewed them, overturning both decisions. But Deep fell soon after to Brydon Carse for seven, with Brook trapping him at third slip with a low dive. Sundar brought the scores level with a flick to the mid-wicket, before Woakes dismissed Jaspreet Bumrah for a duck in the very next ball to bag his third wicket. Jofra Archer got Sundar out for 23 to bring an end to India’s innings, leaving the match finely poised going into the final two days.","kl rahul score century ravindra jadeja rishabh pant pitch crucial fifty india post equal england first inning heat day field lord injury shoaib bashir blunt england pace spin attack strategy india look vulnerable five wicket lose pant rahul quick succession jadeja steady inning fifty plus knock row england opener zak crawley ben duckett play single jasprit bumrah stump remain unbeaten five match series remain tie side look go win test two overs schedule bowl stump temper start flare crawley pull stance four time late call physio england inning tourist irate mohammed siraj display thunderous look bumrah slow handclapped india skipper shubman gill confront crawley point finger opener face india start good overnight score leave hand batter pant score twin century first test battle injure finger leave hand hook england captain stoke six bring fifty year old survive awkward hook short ball stoke almost get catch near fine leg boundary dive crawley lob ball back inside prevent six pant run last ball lunch try take quick single play bashir towards cover point stoke make quick turn hit stump non striker end swift direct throw opener rahul next fall edge bashir flighted ball harry brook slip next ball reach leave india shaky grind warm london sun bashir leave grind injure finger non bowl leave hand attempt low catch delivery jadeja shoot wicket commentator say year old may need extra treatment even jadeja nitish kumar reddy new crease look unsteady england bowler pile pressure mix up batter put reddy risk get run two occasion ollie pope direct throw miss target time however england return use two pacer soon bashir injury pair put together run partnership stoke claim wicket match get reddy nick keeper jamie smith jadeja drive joe root long four complete half century washington sundar take slow cautious approach end run partnership wicket get india within run england total chris woakes dismiss jadeja batter attempt send ball fine leg take thin edge land smith glove akash deep numb nine give leg wicket twice umpire sharfuddoula saikat hawk eye show ball miss stump batter review overturn decision deep fall soon brydon carse seven brook trap slip low diva sundar bring score level flick mid wicket woakes dismiss jaspreet bumrah duck next ball bag wicket jofra arch get sundar bring end india inning leave match finely poise go final two day"

The Polish eighth seed, who has now won all six major finals in which she has competed, was in charge from the first point and wrapped up victory in just 57 minutes on Saturday. It is the first time a woman has won a final at Wimbledon without dropping a game since 1911. And Swiatek, 24, is just the second player in the Open era to win a major title without losing a game in the final after Steffi Graf beat Natalia Zvereva at the 1988 French Open. Swiatek, who reached the final of the grass-court tournament at Bad Homburg two weeks ago, has looked increasingly strong while the top seeds tumbled at the All England Club. She lost just one set in her run to the final. But US 13th-seed Anisimova was expected to prove a stern test after ousting world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the semifinals. Anisimova made a nervous start in hot conditions on Centre Court. She was broken in the first game, soon slipping 2-0 behind, and the signs looked ominous. She appeared to have found her feet in her next service game, but the tenacious Swiatek refused to give ground and recovered to move 3-0 ahead when Anisimova double-faulted. At 4-0 down, Anisimova was facing a first-set wipe-out, but she was powerless to halt the rampant Swiatek, who sealed the first set 6-0 in just 25 minutes. The American won just six points on her serve in the first set and committed 14 unforced errors. An increasingly desperate Anisimova could not stem the tide in the second set, double-faulting again in the third game to give her opponent game point and then netting a backhand. The crowd got behind her, but to no avail as Swiatek kept up her level, serving out to win and celebrating before consoling her devastated opponent. The distraught Anisimova left the court briefly before returning for the trophy presentation. Swiatek is Wimbledon’s eighth consecutive first-time women’s champion since Serena Williams won her seventh and final title at the All England Club in 2016.","iga swiatek demolish amanda anisimova one side woman wimbledon final year seal grand slam polish seed now win six major final compete charge first point wrap victory just minute saturday first time woman win final wimbledon without drop game since swiatek just player open era win major title without lose game final steffi graf beat natalia zvereva french open swiatek reach final grass court tournament bad homburg two week ago look increasingly strong top seed tumble england club lose just one set run final us th seed anisimova expect prove stern test oust world numb one aryna sabalenka semifinal anisimova make nervous start hot condition centre court break first game soon slip behind sign look ominous appear find foot next service game tenacious swiatek refuse give grind recover move ahead anisimova double fault anisimova face first set wipe powerless halt rampant swiatek seal first set just minute american win just six point serve first set commit unforced error increasingly desperate anisimova stem tide set double fault game give opponent game point net backhand crowd get behind avail swiatek keep level serve win celebrate console devastate opponent distraught anisimova leave court briefly return trophy presentation swiatek wimbledon consecutive first time woman champion since serena williams win final title england club"

Palmer had almost identical left-footed goals from just inside the penalty area in the 22nd and 30th minutes on Saturday, and then sent a through pass that enabled Pedro to chip goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma in the 43rd for his third goal in two starts with the Blues. “It’s a great feeling. Even better, because everyone doubted us before the game. We knew we had to put up a fight against a great team,” player of the match Palmer said afterwards. A 23-year-old who joined Chelsea from Manchester City two years ago, Palmer scored 18 goals this season. PSG finished a man short after Joao Neves was given a red card in the 84th minute for pulling down Marc Cucurella by his hair. After a testy final few minutes, the teams needed to be separated as PSG coach Luis Enrique and Donnarumma pushed Pedro near the centre circle. A heavy favourite who had outscored opponents 16-1, PSG had been looking to complete a quadruple after winning Ligue 1, the Coupe de France and its first Champions League title. Before a tournament-high crowd of 81,188 at MetLife Stadium, which included United States President Donald Trump, Chelsea showed the energy of a fourth day of rest after its semifinal, one more than PSG. Chelsea had finished fourth in the Premier League and won the third-tier UEFA Conference League. The Blues took the world title for the second time after 2021, when it was a seven-team event. The Blues earned $128.4m to $153.8m in prize money, the amount depending on a participation fee FIFA has not disclosed. PSG had not lost by three goals since a 4-1 Champions League defeat at Newcastle in October 2023. Chelsea went ahead in the 22nd after goalkeeper Robert Sanchez kicked the ball downfield and Nuno Mendes mis-hit his header 15 yards past the midfield stripe towards his own goal. Malo Gusto’s shot was blocked by Lucas Beraldo, and rebounded to Palmer, who ended PSG’s streak of 436 minutes without conceding. Palmer doubled the lead in the 30th when he ran onto a long ball from Levi Colwill, and cut inside before shooting. Chelsea heads into the 2025-26 season, which starts in less than five weeks, believing it can challenge Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal for the Premier League title.","cole palmer score twice feed joao pedro goal chelsea overwhelm paris saint germain first half beat european champion final first expand fifa club world cup palmer almost identical leave foot goal just inside penalty area nd th minute saturday send pass enable pedro chip goalkeeper gianluigi donnarumma rd goal two start blue great feel even good everyone doubt us game know put fight great team player match palmer say afterwards year old join chelsea manchester city two year ago palmer score goal season psg finish man short joao neves give red card th minute pull marc cucurella hair testy final minute team need separate psg coach luis enrique donnarumma push pedro near centre circle heavy favourite outscored opponent psg look complete quadruple win ligue coupe de france first champion league title tournament high crowd metlife stadium include unite state president donald trump chelsea show energy day rest semifinal one psg chelsea finish premier league win tier uefa conference league blue take world title time seven team event blue earn be be prize money amount depend participation fee fifa disclose psg lose three goal since champion league defeat newcastle october chelsea go ahead nd goalkeeper robert sanchez kick ball downfield nuno mendes mis hit header yard past midfield stripe towards goal malo gusto shoot block lucas beraldo rebound palmer end psg streak minute without concede palmer double lead th run onto long ball levi colwill cut inside shoot chelsea head season start little five week believe can challenge liverpool manchester city arsenal premier league title"
"Revenge is served as Sinner outclasses Alcaraz to win Wimbledon","Top seed Sinner defeats Alcaraz 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 in the final to win his first Wimbledon and fourth Grand Slam title.","Published On 13 Jul 202513 Jul 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/13/sinner-beats-alcaraz-to-win-wimbledon-2025-grand-slam-title","sports/","Wimbledon, United Kingdom – It has taken Jannik Sinner just five weeks to exact revenge against Carlos Alcaraz in their blockbuster tennis rivalry and win the men’s singles final at Wimbledon 2025. The top-seeded Italian overcame the emotional and physical toll of losing the French Open final to Alcaraz by defeating the Spaniard 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in London on Sunday. Sinner turned the tables on the defending champion by overcoming a loss in the first set – and some early nerves – to win his fourth Grand Slam trophy and first on the famous Centre Court at SW19. Two-time champion Alcaraz began the final with a strong service game, pouncing on Sinner’s nervous start in his first appearance in a Wimbledon final. The 22-year-old went on to break the world number one’s serve and wrap up the first set in 45 minutes, deploying a serve-and-volley style strategy to win the crucial points. Sinner dug deep in the second set and was back to his ice-cool self as he applied the brakes on Alcaraz’s attempt for a three-peat of titles at Wimbledon. The quality of tennis went up a notch as the 23-year-old matched Alcaraz shot for shot and left the crowd gasping at every other point. Sinner didn’t waste much time in breaking back against the defending champion by deploying an excellent service game to keep Alcaraz at bay, altering his speed and delivery to ensure his opponent scurried for every point. He was soon on level terms. The third set was, by far, the highlight of the final as both players threw everything at each other with sensational court coverage, scintillating aces, sublime drop shots and even a “tweener”. It was end-to-end action up until the eighth game, when Alcaraz slipped up by the barest of margins but ended up having his serve broken. Sinner wasted no time to bring out his ruthless streak and finish off Alcaraz’s chances in the set. Leading the final two sets to one, Sinner stepped on the gas in the fourth and ensured there would be no late Alcaraz comeback as so memorably occurred in the French Open final on June 8. He broke Alcaraz in the third game, and the stoic Italian showed a glimpse of emotion as he looked towards his team in the stands. Crowd favourite Alcaraz had most of the capacity crowd on Centre Court behind him, including King Felipe of Spain, but it was not enough to help him stay in the final for one more set as Sinner sealed the trophy with a faultless service game. With joy and disbelief etched on his face, and with the match now over, Sinner raised both arms with a jolt before squatting down on the court to pat the grass with the other hand, all the while hiding the emotions on his face. Not only did he avenge his French Open final loss with a fourth major trophy, Sinner also moved to within one Grand Slam title of his great contemporary Alcaraz. The two-time Australian Open champion has become the first man from Italy to win the Wimbledon title, a feat he described as akin to “a dream of a dream”. “I had never thought of being in this position [to win Wimbledon] growing up so far away from here,” an unusually emotional Sinner said on court after the match. “I had a very tough loss in Paris, but I tried to understand what I did wrong and kept working [hard].” Sinner has now won Grand Slam titles on two of the three surfaces and said he was happy to have held his nerve while serving for the championship in the fourth set. Alcaraz, ever the gracious opponent in defeat as in victory, kept up his applause for Sinner even after returning to his chair after losing the match. But he said it was a difficult loss. “I love playing here and I’m going to be back for sure,” the Spaniard told his fans on Centre Court. Both players walked off to a loud round of applause after providing yet another enthralling glimpse into another “golden era” of tennis. Sinner and Alcaraz have won all seven Grand Slam finals since the beginning of 2024, and it will only be a matter of eight weeks until tennis fans can hope to see the next instalment of their flourishing rivalry at the last Grand Slam of the year, the US Open.","wimbledon unite kingdom take jannik sinner just five week exact revenge carlos alcaraz blockbuster tennis rivalry win man single final wimbledon top seed italian overcome emotional physical toll lose french open final alcaraz defeat spaniard england lawn tennis croquet club london sunday sinner turn table defend champion overcome loss first set early nerve win grand slam trophy first famous centre court sw two time champion alcaraz begin final strong service game pounce sinner nervous start first appearance wimbledon final year old go break world numb one serve wrap first set minute deploy serve volley style strategy win crucial point sinner dig deep set back ice cool self apply brake alcaraz attempt three peat title wimbledon quality tennis go notch year old match alcaraz shoot shoot leave crowd gasp every point sinner didn waste much time break back defend champion deploy excellent service game keep alcaraz bay alter speed delivery ensure opponent scurry every point soon level term set far highlight final player throw everything sensational court coverage scintillate ace sublime drop shot even tweener end end action game alcaraz slip bare margin end serve break sinner waste time bring ruthless streak finish alcaraz chance set lead final two set one sinner step gas ensure late alcaraz comeback memorably occur french open final june break alcaraz game stoic italian show glimpse emotion look towards team stand crowd favourite alcaraz capacity crowd centre court behind include king felipe spain enough help stay final one set sinner seal trophy faultless service game joy disbelief etch face match now sinner raise arm jolt squat court pat grass hand hide emotion face avenge french open final loss major trophy sinner also move within one grand slam title great contemporary alcaraz two time australian open champion become first man italy win wimbledon title feat describe akin dream dream never think position win wimbledon grow far away unusually emotional sinner say court match tough loss paris try understand wrong keep work hard sinner now win grand slam title two three surface say happy hold nerve serve championship set alcaraz ever gracious opponent defeat victory keep applause sinner even return chair lose match say difficult loss love play be go back sure spaniard tell fan centre court player walk loud round applause provide yet another enthrall glimpse another golden era tennis sinner alcaraz win seven grand slam final since begin matter eight week tennis fan can hope see next instalment flourish rivalry last grand slam year us open"

"Marquez reigns supreme to win German MotoGP after only 10 riders finish","Marc Marquez stages a lights-to-flag victory to record his ninth German MotoGP victory as podium contenders crash out.","Published On 13 Jul 202513 Jul 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/13/marc-marquez-wins-chaotic-german-motogp-at-sachsenring","sports/","Marc Marquez proved once again why he is known as the “King of Sachsenring” when the Ducati rider marked his 200th MotoGP start by winning the German Grand Prix in a race that became a test of survival after only 10 of 18 riders finished. Marquez’s ninth MotoGP victory at the Sachsenring stretched his championship lead over brother Alex, who finished second, to 83 points while Marc’s teammate Francesco Bagnaia finished third to sit 147 points behind.     Alex Marquez had started fifth on the grid and took second in his 100th MotoGP start despite still recovering from a fractured hand he suffered at the Dutch Grand Prix two weeks ago, which required surgery. Several riders crashed over the course of the race, especially at turn one – including VR46 Racing’s Fabio Di Giannantonio and Aprilia’s Marco Bezzecchi when they were in second place. But the day belonged to Marc Marquez as he marked his latest triumph at his favourite hunting ground by standing on his bike and doing a jig as he passed the chequered flag – a fourth straight weekend where he had won both the sprint and the race. “One more [win at the Sachsenring] was super special. From the beginning, I felt good, the confidence when I started the weekend was super high because we were coming from three victories in a row,” he said. “We are in an incredible moment. Now we can say that half the season is done. Now [the second] half we still need to be super concentrated.” Pedro Acosta became the third rider to crash early on after Lorenzo Savadori and Miguel Oliveira, with the young Spaniard gesturing at his fallen machine in frustration. Di Giannantonio had broken the lap record in Friday’s practice and given Marc Marquez a tough time early in the sprint race on Saturday. But the Italian was unable to push any harder to catch up to Marquez, who found a comfortable rhythm and pace to surge more than two seconds ahead despite easing off the throttle on two laps to conserve his tyres. As Marquez’s lead stretched to more than three seconds, Di Giannantonio’s challenge came to an end on the downhill braking zone on turn one when he lost control and crashed, with his bike tumbling across the gravel while he escaped unhurt. LCR Honda’s Johann Zarco, who started second on the grid before getting pushed down the order, crashed at the same turn seconds later.

"Lionel Messi extends MLS goals streak as Miami ends Nashville’s run","The Argentinian superstar extends his multigoal record run with a brace against Nashville at Chase Stadium.","Published On 13 Jul 202513 Jul 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/13/lionel-messi-scores-twice-as-inter-miami-beat-nashville-in-mls","sports/","Lionel Messi has extended his MLS-record scoring streak with two more goals, which made the difference in a 2-1 victory for hosts Inter Miami over Nashville SC in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The 38-year-old’s brace on Saturday helped Inter Miami (11-3-5, 38 points) snap a club-record 15-game unbeaten streak across all competitions for Nashville (12-5-5, 41 points), which lost for the first time since April 19 at Seattle. Messi scored two or more goals for the fifth consecutive time in an MLS match, which is a league record. Inter Miami improved to 4-0-1 in its last five matches with Nashville while also winning their fifth consecutive MLS match overall. Miami has won three in a row since it was eliminated by Paris Saint-Germain in the round of 16 at the FIFA Club World Cup on June 29. Messi capitalised on a major mistake by Nashville goalkeeper Joe Willis to strike for what turned out to be the match-winning goal in the 62nd minute. Willis chested a ball and tried to clear it out of his zone but kicked it right in Messi’s direction. Messi intercepted it with his left foot, then worked the ball around Willis and fired it home to put Miami ahead for good. The goal came 13 minutes after Nashville’s Hany Mukhtar tied the game at 1-1 with a perfectly timed header off a pinpoint cross from distance by Andy Najar. It was Mukhtar’s 10th goal of the season. Patrick Yazbek also had an assist. Messi’s first goal came in the 17th minute on another spectacular free-kick score. Messi fired a ball precisely through a gap in the wall set up by Nashville’s defenders, and it found the mark just out of the reach of a diving Willis. Messi with his 16 goals this season is tied for the most in the league with Nashville’s Sam Surridge, who was kept off the scoresheet on Saturday. Messi has 23 goal contributions in MLS games this season and has 22 goals across all competitions. Each side returns to action on Wednesday as Inter Miami will play at Cincinnati and Nashville will host Columbus.","lionel messi extend ml record score streak two goal make difference victory host inter miami nashville sc fort lauderdale florida year old brace saturday help inter miami point snap club record game unbeaten streak across competition nashville point lose first time since april seattle messi score two goal consecutive time ml match league record inter miami improve last five match nashville also win consecutive ml match overall miami win three row since eliminate paris saint germain round fifa club world cup june messi capitalise major mistake nashville goalkeeper joe willis strike turn match win goal nd minute willis chested ball try clear zone kick right messi direction messi intercept leave foot work ball around willis fire home put miami ahead good goal come minute nashville hany mukhtar tie game perfectly time header pinpoint cross distance andy najar mukhtar th goal season patrick yazbek also assist messi first goal come th minute another spectacular free kick score messi fire ball precisely gap wall set nashville defender find mark just reach dive willis messi goal season tie league nashville sam surridge keep scoresheet saturday messi goal contribution ml game season goal across competition side return action wednesday inter miami play cincinnati nashville host columbus"
"‘Fire vs ice’: Is Alcaraz vs Sinner the next big tennis rivalry?","Ahead of their Wimbledon final, fans and legends predict the players to light up the tennis world in years to come.","Published On 12 Jul 202512 Jul 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/12/alcaraz-vs-sinner-tennis-champions-set-to-resume-rivalry-at-wimbledon-2025","sports/","Wimbledon, United Kingdom – Expectations will run high, and so will the temperatures in southwest London, when Carlos Alcaraz steps on Centre Court to defend his Wimbledon title against Jannik Sinner on Sunday. The next instalment of an enthralling rivalry between the top two players in men’s tennis will come under the limelight once again at one of the biggest stages in the game – the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club – on a hot afternoon in the United Kingdom’s capital. Two-time Wimbledon champion Alcaraz expects to be pushed to the limit by world number one Sinner in a meeting that has already drawn comparisons with the great Wimbledon finals of the modern era. “I expect to be on the limit, to be on the line [in the final],” Alcaraz said while speaking to the media moments after Sinner’s near-faultless semifinal 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win over Novak Djokovic on Friday. A few hours earlier, the Spaniard had booked a spot in his third consecutive Wimbledon final with a resilient performance against Taylor Fritz, which brought him a 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6 (8-6) win. It will be the 13th on-court meeting between the two, and their second Grand Slam final in the space of five weeks. Their duel in the French Open final lasted five hours and 29 minutes and added fuel to the fiery-yet-friendly rivalry between the young tennis stars. 🚨 THE REMATCH IS HAPPENING 🚨@janniksin will face @carlosalcaraz in the Wimbledon final on Sunday!@Wimbledon | #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/JedFZHXoZL — ATP Tour (@atptour) July 11, 2025  Alcaraz knows his opponent all too well and expects nothing short of another spectacle. “Whatever Jannik has is because he has learned from everything – he just gets better after every match, every day,” Alcaraz said of the top seed. The Spaniard said he expected Sinner to be in better shape mentally and physically for the Wimbledon final, but that he was not looking forward to another hours-long match. “I just hope not to be five and a half hours on court again. But if I have to, I will.” Meanwhile, Sinner – the tall, stoic and speedy Italian who stands between Alcaraz and a chance to become only the fifth man to win three straight Wimbledon titles – believes beating the holder will be “very tough”. “I’m very happy to share the court with Carlos once again. It’s going to be difficult, I know that,” Sinner said on Friday. The Australian Open champion said he loves playing Grand Slam finals – Sunday’s will be his fifth in two years. “I always try to put myself in these kinds of situations that I really love. Sundays at every tournament are very special.” The 23-year-old from northern Italy termed Alcaraz as the favourite, given his record at the tournament and on grass courts. “He is the favourite. He won here the last two times. He’s again in the final. It’s very tough to beat him on grass, but I like these challenges.” Out of the 12 occasions that both players have met, four have been at Grand Slams, but this is only their second meeting in the final. The pair’s only other meeting at Wimbledon came in the fourth round in 2022, when Sinner won 6-1, 6-4, 6-7 (6-8), 6-3. Alcaraz, however, brushed aside the reference by saying that both men are changed players from what they were three years ago. “We’re completely different players on grass and on all surfaces.” The 22-year-old from Murcia, in southeastern Spain, will be buoyed by his 5-0 record against Sinner in the past two years. Despite Alcaraz’s success against his nemesis, it is Sinner who has consistently topped the men’s rankings by racking up regular wins and points on the ATP circuit. All things considered, there is not much that separates the two ahead of their highly anticipated match. Just ask Djokovic. While the 24-time Grand Slam champion picked Alcaraz due to his past success at Wimbledon, Djokovic predicted “a very close match-up, like they had in Paris” when asked to choose a winner. “I think I will give a slight edge to Carlos because of the two titles he’s won here and the way he’s playing and the confidence he has right now, but it’s just a slight advantage, because Jannik is hitting the ball extremely well.” It is not just their contrasting styles of play – Sinner relies on his baseline game and shot speed, while Alcaraz likes to cover the court with his nimble footwork and excellent coverage – but also their on-court personalities that set the two apart while making them an engaging pair to watch. Before the French Open final, Alcaraz said in an interview that a “fire vs ice” analogy fits them perfectly. “I guess you can say I am like fire because of the way I react on court and show emotions, while Jannik remains calm,” the Spaniard said with his trademark smile. For the fans, though, the pair offer another chance to pick sides and look forward to tennis tournaments that could pit the two against each other. “It’s a dream final,” Catherine Shaw, a tennis fan who watched both the men’s semifinals on Centre Court, told Al Jazeera. “They are the next big thing when it comes to tennis rivalries, so it’s exciting times for tennis fans.” Stepping out in the shadows of some of the greatest players and rivals – Stefan Edberg vs Ivan Lendl, Bjorn Borg vs John McEnroe, Andre Agassi vs Pete Sampras and Rafael Nadal vs Roger Federer – the young players will have big shoes to fill. Both are aware of the weight their match-up carries but refuse to be compared with their heroes just yet. “I think the things that we are doing right now are great for tennis,” Alcaraz said ahead of the final. “We just fight to engage more people to watch tennis. We’re fighting for tennis to be bigger, as all the tennis players are doing. “For me, it’s sharing the big tournaments with Jannik, or just playing in the finals of the tournaments… We’re still really young. “I hope to keep doing the right things for the next five to 10 years, so our rivalry is on the same table as those players.”","wimbledon unite kingdom expectation run high temperature southwest london carlos alcaraz step centre court defend wimbledon title jannik sinner sunday next instalment enthrall rivalry top two player man tennis come limelight one big stage game england lawn tennis croquet club hot afternoon unite kingdom capital two time wimbledon champion alcaraz expect push limit world numb one sinner meet already draw comparison great wimbledon final modern era expect limit line final alcaraz say speak medium moment sinner near faultless semifinal win novak djokovic friday hour early spaniard book spot consecutive wimbledon final resilient performance taylor fritz bring win th court meet two grand slam final space five week duel french open final last five hour minute add fuel fiery yet friendly rivalry young tennis star rematch happen janniksin face carlosalcaraz wimbledon final sunday wimbledon wimbledon pic twitter com jedfzhxozl atp tour atptour july alcaraz know opponent good expect nothing short another spectacle whatever jannik learn everything just get good every match every day alcaraz say top seed spaniard say expect sinner good shape mentally physically wimbledon final look forward another hour long match just hope five half hour court meanwhile sinner tall stoic speedy italian stand alcaraz chance become man win three straight wimbledon title believe beat holder tough be happy share court carlos go difficult know sinner say friday australian open champion say love play grand slam final sunday two year always try put kind situation really love sunday every tournament special year old northern italy term alcaraz favourite give record tournament grass court favourite win last two time final tough beat grass like challenge occasion player meet four grand slam meet final pair meet wimbledon come round sinner win alcaraz however brush aside reference say man change player three year ago re completely different player grass surface year old murcia southeastern spain buoy record sinner past two year despite alcaraz success nemesis sinner consistently top man ranking rack regular win point atp circuit thing consider much separate two ahead highly anticipate match just ask djokovic time grand slam champion pick alcaraz due past success wimbledon djokovic predict close match like paris ask choose winner think give slight edge carlos two title win way play confidence right now just slight advantage jannik hit ball extremely good just contrast style play sinner rely baseline game shoot speed alcaraz like cover court nimble footwork excellent coverage also court personality set two apart make engage pair watch french open final alcaraz say interview fire vs ice analogy fit perfectly guess can say like fire way react court show emotion jannik remain calm spaniard say trademark smile fan though pair offer another chance pick side look forward tennis tournament pit two dream final catherine shaw tennis fan watch man semifinal centre court tell al jazeera next big thing come tennis rivalry excite time tennis fan step shadow great player rival stefan edberg vs ivan lendl bjorn borg vs john mcenroe andre agassi vs pete sampras rafael nadal vs roger federer young player big shoe fill aware weight match carry refuse compare hero just yet think thing right now great tennis alcaraz say ahead final just fight engage people watch tennis re fight tennis big tennis player share big tournament jannik just play final tournament re still really young hope keep right thing next five year rivalry table player"

The first 32-team edition of the tournament faced criticism in the build-up for stretching demands on elite players and has been played out in baking temperatures in the United States that have raised concerns for the health of those involved. There were also doubts about the level of interest the competition would generate among fans, but Infantino said he was satisfied with the attendance at matches, despite many games being far from sold out, and claimed it had been a major success financially. “The golden age of club football has started. We can definitely say this FIFA Club World Cup has been a huge success,” Infantino told reporters at Trump Tower on New York City’s Fifth Avenue, where FIFA has just opened an office. “We heard that financially it would not work, that nobody is interested, but I can say we generated almost $2.1bn in revenues, for 63 matches,” he said. “That makes an average of $33m per match – no other club competition in the world comes close. “It is already the most successful club competition in the world.” Former Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp has been one of the leading voices against the tournament, calling it “the worst idea ever implemented in football” in a recent interview. But the head of world football’s governing body dismissed suggestions that Klopp might be speaking for most observers in Europe. “We shouldn’t say that the opinion of Europe on this is very bad because it is not true,” said Infantino, who was appearing on a stage alongside numerous footballing greats, including the Brazilian Ronaldo. “All the teams who have come here have been happy – some teams who didn’t come here because they didn’t qualify were calling us to see how they could qualify. “Of course, I would have liked to have Liverpool here, Arsenal, Manchester United, Barcelona, Tottenham, AC Milan, Napoli … but you have to qualify and there are different criteria.” The next Club World Cup is due to take place in 2029, with Infantino refusing to commit when asked whether the tournament could be played every two years or be expanded to feature more teams. “We created something new, something which is here to stay, something which is changing the landscape of club football,” he added.","fifa president gianni infantino triumphantly declare club world cup successful club competition world saturday weekend final paris saint germain chelsea first team edition tournament face criticism build stretch demand elite player play bake temperature unite state raise concern health involve also doubt level interest competition generate among fan infantino say satisfy attendance match despite many game far sell claim major success financially golden age club football start can definitely say fifa club world cup huge success infantino tell reporter trump tower new york city avenue fifa just open office hear financially work nobody interest can say generate almost bn revenue match say make average be per match club competition world come close already successful club competition world former liverpool coach jurgen klopp one lead voice tournament call bad idea ever implement football recent interview head world football govern body dismiss suggestion klopp may speak observer europe shouldn say opinion europe bad true say infantino appear stage alongside numerous footballing great include brazilian ronaldo team come happy team didn come didn qualify call us see qualify course like liverpool arsenal manchester unite barcelona tottenham ac milan napoli qualify different criterion next club world cup due take place infantino refuse commit ask whether tournament play every two year expand feature team create something new something stay something change landscape club football add"
"India level up with England as tempers nearly boil over at Lord’s","India post 387 to match England’s first innings in the third Test but tempers flare before stumps on third day.","Published On 12 Jul 202512 Jul 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/12/india-level-up-with-england-as-tempers-nearly-boil-over-at-lords","sports/","KL Rahul scored a century while Ravindra Jadeja and Rishabh Pant pitched in with crucial fifties as India posted 387, equalling England’s first innings, on a heated third day on and off the field at Lord’s An injury to Shoaib Bashir blunted England’s pace-spin attack strategy when India looked vulnerable with five wickets down after losing Pant and Rahul in quick succession, before Jadeja steadied their innings with his third fifty-plus knock in a row.     England openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett, who played a single over from Jasprit Bumrah before stumps, remained unbeaten at 2-0 as the five-match series remains tied as both sides look to go 2-1 up with a win in the third Test. With two overs scheduled to be bowled before stumps, tempers started to flare when Crawley pulled out of his stance four times – and later in the over called for the physio in what would be the only over of England’s second innings. The tourists were irate with Mohammed Siraj displaying a thunderous look, before Bumrah slow handclapped and India skipper Shubman Gill confronted Crawley, pointing a finger in the opener’s face. India started well from an overnight score of 145-3 as left-handed batter Pant, who scored twin centuries in the first test, battled through an injured finger on his left hand as he hooked England captain Stokes for six to bring up his fifty. The 27-year-old survived when an awkward hook on a short ball from Stokes almost got him caught near the fine leg boundary, but a diving Crawley could only lob the ball back inside to prevent a six. But Pant was run out for 74 on the last ball before lunch as he tried to take a quick single after playing Bashir towards cover point, where Stokes made a quick turn to hit the stumps on the non-striker’s end with a swift, direct throw. Opener Rahul was the next to fall, edging Bashir’s flighted ball to Harry Brook in the slip on his very next ball after reaching 100, leaving India on shaky ground at 254-5 under a warm London sun. But Bashir had to leave the ground when he injured a finger on his non-bowling left hand while attempting a low catch from his own delivery as Jadeja shot down the wicket, with commentators saying the 21-year-old might need extra treatment in the evening. Jadeja and Nitish Kumar Reddy, new to the crease, looked unsteady as England’s bowlers piled on the pressure. Mix-ups between the batters put Reddy at risk of getting run out on two occasions, but Ollie Pope’s direct throws missed the target both times. However, as England returned to using two pacers soon after Bashir’s injury, the pair put together a 72-run partnership before Stokes claimed his second wicket of the match, getting Reddy to nick it to keeper Jamie Smith for 30. Jadeja drove Joe Root down long off for four to complete his half-century, while Washington Sundar took a slow, cautious approach on the other end. Their 50-run partnership for the eighth wicket got India within 11 runs of England’s total, before Chris Woakes dismissed Jadeja for 72 as the batter’s attempt to send the ball down fine leg only took a thin edge and landed in Smith’s gloves. Akash Deep, in at number nine, was given out leg before wicket twice by umpire Sharfuddoula Saikat during the same over, but Hawk-Eye showed the ball was missing the stumps when the batter reviewed them, overturning both decisions. But Deep fell soon after to Brydon Carse for seven, with Brook trapping him at third slip with a low dive. Sundar brought the scores level with a flick to the mid-wicket, before Woakes dismissed Jaspreet Bumrah for a duck in the very next ball to bag his third wicket. Jofra Archer got Sundar out for 23 to bring an end to India’s innings, leaving the match finely poised going into the final two days.","kl rahul score century ravindra jadeja rishabh pant pitch crucial fifty india post equal england first inning heat day field lord injury shoaib bashir blunt england pace spin attack strategy india look vulnerable five wicket lose pant rahul quick succession jadeja steady inning fifty plus knock row england opener zak crawley ben duckett play single jasprit bumrah stump remain unbeaten five match series remain tie side look go win test two overs schedule bowl stump temper start flare crawley pull stance four time late call physio england inning tourist irate mohammed siraj display thunderous look bumrah slow handclapped india skipper shubman gill confront crawley point finger opener face india start good overnight score leave hand batter pant score twin century first test battle injure finger leave hand hook england captain stoke six bring fifty year old survive awkward hook short ball stoke almost get catch near fine leg boundary dive crawley lob ball back inside prevent six pant run last ball lunch try take quick single play bashir towards cover point stoke make quick turn hit stump non striker end swift direct throw opener rahul next fall edge bashir flighted ball harry brook slip next ball reach leave india shaky grind warm london sun bashir leave grind injure finger non bowl leave hand attempt low catch delivery jadeja shoot wicket commentator say year old may need extra treatment even jadeja nitish kumar reddy new crease look unsteady england bowler pile pressure mix up batter put reddy risk get run two occasion ollie pope direct throw miss target time however england return use two pacer soon bashir injury pair put together run partnership stoke claim wicket match get reddy nick keeper jamie smith jadeja drive joe root long four complete half century washington sundar take slow cautious approach end run partnership wicket get india within run england total chris woakes dismiss jadeja batter attempt send ball fine leg take thin edge land smith glove akash deep numb nine give leg wicket twice umpire sharfuddoula saikat hawk eye show ball miss stump batter review overturn decision deep fall soon brydon carse seven brook trap slip low diva sundar bring score level flick mid wicket woakes dismiss jaspreet bumrah duck next ball bag wicket jofra arch get sundar bring end india inning leave match finely poise go final two day"

The Polish eighth seed, who has now won all six major finals in which she has competed, was in charge from the first point and wrapped up victory in just 57 minutes on Saturday. It is the first time a woman has won a final at Wimbledon without dropping a game since 1911. And Swiatek, 24, is just the second player in the Open era to win a major title without losing a game in the final after Steffi Graf beat Natalia Zvereva at the 1988 French Open. Swiatek, who reached the final of the grass-court tournament at Bad Homburg two weeks ago, has looked increasingly strong while the top seeds tumbled at the All England Club. She lost just one set in her run to the final. But US 13th-seed Anisimova was expected to prove a stern test after ousting world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the semifinals. Anisimova made a nervous start in hot conditions on Centre Court. She was broken in the first game, soon slipping 2-0 behind, and the signs looked ominous. She appeared to have found her feet in her next service game, but the tenacious Swiatek refused to give ground and recovered to move 3-0 ahead when Anisimova double-faulted. At 4-0 down, Anisimova was facing a first-set wipe-out, but she was powerless to halt the rampant Swiatek, who sealed the first set 6-0 in just 25 minutes. The American won just six points on her serve in the first set and committed 14 unforced errors. An increasingly desperate Anisimova could not stem the tide in the second set, double-faulting again in the third game to give her opponent game point and then netting a backhand. The crowd got behind her, but to no avail as Swiatek kept up her level, serving out to win and celebrating before consoling her devastated opponent. The distraught Anisimova left the court briefly before returning for the trophy presentation. Swiatek is Wimbledon’s eighth consecutive first-time women’s champion since Serena Williams won her seventh and final title at the All England Club in 2016.","iga swiatek demolish amanda anisimova one side woman wimbledon final year seal grand slam polish seed now win six major final compete charge first point wrap victory just minute saturday first time woman win final wimbledon without drop game since swiatek just player open era win major title without lose game final steffi graf beat natalia zvereva french open swiatek reach final grass court tournament bad homburg two week ago look increasingly strong top seed tumble england club lose just one set run final us th seed anisimova expect prove stern test oust world numb one aryna sabalenka semifinal anisimova make nervous start hot condition centre court break first game soon slip behind sign look ominous appear find foot next service game tenacious swiatek refuse give grind recover move ahead anisimova double fault anisimova face first set wipe powerless halt rampant swiatek seal first set just minute american win just six point serve first set commit unforced error increasingly desperate anisimova stem tide set double fault game give opponent game point net backhand crowd get behind avail swiatek keep level serve win celebrate console devastate opponent distraught anisimova leave court briefly return trophy presentation swiatek wimbledon consecutive first time woman champion since serena williams win final title england club"
"How is Pakistan raising money for a 20 percent hike in defence spending?","Pakistan hikes its defence budget by 20 percent after border clashes with India, economy remains reliant on IMF loans.","Published On 12 Jun 202512 Jun 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/12/how-is-pakistan-raising-money-for-a-20-percent-hike-in-defence-spending","tag/india-pakistan-tensions/","Islamabad, Pakistan – Pakistan has increased its defence spending by more than 20 percent – the most substantial hike in a decade – following last month’s military confrontation with neighbouring India. Presenting the annual federal budget on June 10, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb proposed an allocation of 2.55 trillion rupees ($9bn) for the country’s three armed services – the army, air force and navy – amounting to 1.97 percent of Pakistan’s gross domestic product (GDP), up from 1.7 percent in the previous budget. “The security situation in the country is precarious, and the armed forces have rendered commendable service in protecting the borders,” Aurangzeb said during his speech, as India has threatened to carry out strikes if armed groups carry out attacks on India or Indian-administered Kashmir. But analysts say that Islamabad will need to walk a fine balance in spending more on defence at a time when its fragile economy is under strict oversight from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and cuts in social sector expenditure could embolden the opposition. On May 7, India carried out missile strikes on what it called “terrorist infrastructure” in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir after blaming Islamabad for backing fighters responsible for the killing of 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Pahalgam town on April 22. Pakistan denied involvement in the Pahalgam attacks, demanding a “credible, transparent, independent” investigation. Islamabad said innocent civilians were killed in India’s attacks on May 7. Tensions escalated after the two nuclear-armed neighbours engaged in tit-for-tat missile and drone attacks over four days, primarily targeting each other’s military installations. By the time a ceasefire was announced by United States President Donald Trump on May 10, in excess of 70 people had been killed – more than 50 in Pakistan and at least 20 in India. Against that backdrop, Pakistan’s defence hike was expected, say analysts. India, which presented its budget before the conflict, also increased its defence spending to $78.7bn, a 9.5 percent rise from the previous year. But unlike India, Pakistan has more than a neighbour to keep an eye on: It also confronts pressure from the IMF.  The IMF approved a 37-month, $7bn loan programme for Pakistan last September, its 25th since 1958. The most recent tranche of $1.3bn was released in May this year, a day before the ceasefire between India and Pakistan took place. But in exchange, the global lender has been pressuring Pakistan to streamline its expenditure, reduce subsidies and improve the efficiency of its governance structures. Pakistan appears to have paid heed to those demands from the IMF. Even as its defence spending has gone up substantially, its overall budget for the next fiscal year has been reduced to 17.57 trillion rupees ($62bn), marking a 6.9 percent decrease from last year. The defence spending hike, while massive, is in line with growing defence allocation in recent years. The military’s budget has nearly doubled in the past five years. In fiscal year 2020-21, the allocation stood at 1.28 trillion rupees ($4.53bn). The army, long seen as the most powerful institution in Pakistan’s defence and political spheres, has received 1.17 trillion rupees ($4.1bn), accounting for nearly 46 percent of the total defence budget. The air force and navy received just more than 520 billion rupees ($1.8m) and 265.9 billion rupees ($941m), respectively. Pakistan’s military budget increase also reflects a broader global trend. A report published in April by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which specialises in conflict and arms control research, stated that global military expenditure reached $2.7 trillion in 2024, a 9.4 percent increase from the previous year and the “steepest year-on-year rise since the end of the Cold War”. Hina Shaikh, a Lahore-based economist with the International Growth Centre (IGC), said the increase in Pakistan was expected and reflects the government’s continued prioritisation of security amid geopolitical tensions and domestic instability. “While understandable from a strategic lens, this increase does come when economic recovery is just beginning to happen, but still fragile, inflation is easing and fiscal space is constrained,” she told Al Jazeera. Ali Hasanain, an economics professor at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), called the hike in defence spending both “inevitable and necessary” but warned against sacrificing long-term development. “The only way out of this dilemma for Pakistan is to undertake deep structural reforms of the sort which no government has shown a commitment to yet, so that both the economy and defence spending can stay robust over the medium and long terms,” Hasanain said. While most analysts agree that the defence spending hike is a fallout of the May conflict, a major challenge for the government is to fund it without compromising the social welfare, health, or education sectors. Due to Pakistan’s sizable external debt, recorded at $87.4bn according to the latest government figures, the largest share of the national budget is consumed by debt servicing, which stands at $29bn, which is almost 47 percent of total expenditure. In the budget announced on Tuesday, Pakistan’s government has cut subsidies. The budget also outlines plans to expand the tax base, removes exemptions, and introduces new taxes to raise public revenue. The opposition party of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan dubbed the budget “anti-people” and “crafted for the elite.” The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the opposition party said on Wednesday that the budget provided no real relief to the public, as government staff salary raises were low and agriculture, the mainstay of the country’s economy, witnessed decline. Sajid Amin Javed, a senior economist at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), said that the combination of a decline in the interest payments Pakistan owes its debtors this year, and the cut in subsidies had provided the government “some fiscal space”. Still, others highlighted that Pakistan’s defence spending, while the highest in South Asia as a percentage of GDP, has declined in relative terms compared to past decades as it has been forced to set money aside to repay loans. Hasanain of LUMS said that Pakistan now spends less, as a percentage of GDP, than countries like Singapore (2.8 percent), Greece (3.1 percent), Poland (4.2 percent), or the United States (3.4 percent), and nearly three times less than Saudi Arabia (7.3 percent), Russia (7.1 percent), or Israel (8.8 percent). But he pointed out that Pakistan also collects far less tax than most other countries, so the defence spending hike still eats up a giant chunk of the government’s revenue. “A low tax to GDP ratio means that defence spending is a bigger burden for the government in Pakistan than most other countries in the world.” The last few years have been deeply turbulent for Pakistan’s economy. Foreign reserves fell to just under $3bn in 2023, bringing the country of 250 million people to the brink of default. Foreign reserves have since risen to $11bn following IMF deals. Similarly, the Pakistani rupee, having lost more than 60 percent of its value against the US dollar over the last two years, has now stabilised between 280 and 282 rupees per dollar. Javed of SDPI says these indicators show Pakistan’s macroeconomic fundamentals are stabilising, but the public impact remains uncertain. “It is a budget of stabilisation, made in consultation with the IMF, to ensure that the country’s revenue, growth and fiscal deficit targets are met. But on the whole, it remains a traditional budget, with no deep-rooted structural changes or strategic change visible, at least for now,” he said. Economist Shaikh argued that the budget lacks inclusive or pro-poor reforms and shows limited investment in sectors like health and education. “This may be called a technocrat’s budget under IMF constraints, fiscally conservative, tax-heavy, and focused on short-term stabilisation. It is focused on restoring macroeconomic stability, controlling inflation, and building reserves,” she said. Hasanain, however, says that the IMF principally concerns itself with helping countries move back towards stability, and does not consider long-term, sustainable growth as its purview. “By cutting expenditures and running primary budget surpluses, the government is indeed moving out of the acute debt crisis it found itself in two years ago, but the larger project of correcting longstanding structural deficiencies is, despite receiving some lip service, largely neglected to date,” he said. “Given the lack of any serious political opposition, this excessive caution towards reform is deeply frustrating.”","islamabad pakistan pakistan increase defence spend percent substantial hike decade follow last month military confrontation neighbour india present annual federal budget june

"Are India and Pakistan preparing for a naval face-off in a future conflict?","Recent signals from both governments have underscored how their navies could play a central role in their next face-off.","Published On 11 Jun 202511 Jun 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/11/are-india-and-pakistan-preparing-for-a-naval-faceoff-in-a-future-conflict","tag/india-pakistan-tensions/","Islamabad, Pakistan – When Indian Minister of Defence Rajnath Singh visited the Indian Navy’s aircraft carrier INS Vikrant on May 30, nearly three weeks after a ceasefire was announced with Pakistan after a four-day conflict, he had stern words for Islamabad. Wearing an Indian Navy baseball cap, with his initial “R” emblazoned on it, Singh declared that Pakistan was fortunate the Indian Navy had not been called upon during the recent hostilities. “Despite remaining silent, the Indian Navy succeeded in tying down the Pakistani Army. Just imagine what will happen when someone who can keep a country’s army locked in a bottle, even by remaining silent, speaks up?” Singh said, standing in front of a Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jet on the deck of the 262-metre-long (860 feet) ship. Just two days later, on June 1, the Pakistan Navy issued a pointed response. In a message posted on X, it announced a two-day exercise, “focusing on countering sub-conventional and asymmetric threats across all major ports and harbours of Pakistan”. PN conducted 2-day Ex focusing on countering sub-conventional & asymmetric threats across all major ports & harbours of Pak, aimed at validating & refining Tactics, Techniques & Procedures to ensure robust defence of critical maritime infrastructure against asymmetric threats.1/3 pic.twitter.com/R1IsajwyBB — DGPR (Navy) (@dgprPaknavy) June 1, 2025   These symbolic shows of strength followed India’s “Operation Sindoor” and Pakistan’s “Operation Bunyan Marsoos“, the countries’ respective codenames for the four-day conflict that ended in a ceasefire on May 10. The standoff was triggered by an April 22 attack in Pahalgam, in Indian-administered Kashmir, in which 26 civilians, almost all tourists, were killed. India blamed armed groups allegedly backed by Pakistan, a charge Islamabad denied. On May 7, India launched missile strikes at multiple sites in Pakistan’s Punjab province and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, killing at least 51 people, including 11 soldiers and several children. Over the next three days, the two countries exchanged artillery and air power, hitting each other’s airbases. The 96 hours of conflict brought 1.6 billion people to the brink of war. But while the navies largely remained passive observers, they monitored each other’s movements – and were ready for action. Satellite imagery showed that the INS Vikrant moved towards Pakistan soon after the Pahalgam attack and remained deployed for four days in the Arabian Sea before returning to its base in Karnataka. Pakistan also mobilised its fleet, which was bolstered by the docking of a Turkish naval ship in Karachi on May 2. According to the Pakistani Navy, Turkish personnel engaged in “a series of professional interactions” with their counterparts. Now, even amid the current pause in military tensions, analysts say Singh’s remarks and Pakistan’s naval drills highlight the growing part that maritime forces could play in the next chapter of their conflict. This is a role the Indian and Pakistani navies are well-versed in. After independence from Britain in August 1947, India inherited two-thirds of British India’s naval assets. These saw no use during the first India-Pakistan war in 1947, over the contested Himalayan region of Kashmir. India and Pakistan both administer parts of Kashmir, along with China, which governs two thin strips. India claims all of Kashmir, while Pakistan claims all the parts not controlled by China, its ally. By the 1965 war, also over Kashmir, Pakistan had expanded its fleet with aid from the United States and United Kingdom, its Cold War allies. It had acquired Ghazi, a long-range submarine, giving it an edge over India, which lacked a submarine at the time, though it owned an aircraft carrier. Pakistan, to date, does not have an aircraft carrier. While the land war started on September 6, the Pakistan Navy joined the conflict on the night of September 7-8. A fleet of seven warships and submarine PNS Ghazi left Karachi harbour and made their way towards the Indian naval base of Dwarka in the western state of Gujarat, roughly 350km (217 miles) away. They were tasked with carrying out the “bombardment of Dwarka about midnight using 50 rounds per ship”, according to the Pakistan Navy’s official account, targeting the base’s radar and other installations. The selection of Dwarka was significant from a historical and strategic perspective. The city is home to one of the most sacred sites for Hindus, the Somnath Temple, on which the Pakistan Navy named its operation. Militarily, the radar installations in Dwarka were used to provide guidance to the Indian Air Force. Knocking them out would have made it harder for India to launch aerial attacks against Pakistani cities, especially Karachi. That, in turn, would have forced India to send out its warships from the nearby port of Bombay (now Mumbai) – and PNS Ghazi, the submarine, could have ambushed them. But the Pakistani plan only partly worked. Many Indian warships were under maintenance, and so the Indian Navy did not send them out to chase the Pakistani fleet. According to the Pakistan Navy’s accounts, after firing about 350 rounds, the operation ended in “four minutes” and all its ships returned safely. Syed Muhammad Obaidullah, a former commodore in the Pakistan Navy, recalled the attack. “We were able to send eight vessels, seven ships and a submarine – that surprised the Indians, as our ships targeted the radar station used to assist Indian planes,” Obaidullah told Al Jazeera. Muhammad Shareh Qazi, a Lahore-based maritime security expert, added that the operation was a tactical surprise, but did not lead to any gains in territory or of the maritime continental shelf. “All our ships returned safely, without resistance, but it was only an operational-level success for the PN, not a strategic one,” he said, referring to the Pakistan Navy. Official Indian Navy records claim that most of the shells fired by Pakistani ships caused no damage and remained unexploded. Anjali Ghosh, a professor of international relations at Jadavpur University, Kolkata, in her book India’s Foreign Policy, described the attack as “daring” but symbolic rather than strategically meaningful.  The 1971 war, fought over East Pakistan’s secession to become Bangladesh, saw more substantial naval engagements. India launched two operations – Trident and Python – which dealt major blows to Pakistan’s Navy, sinking several ships, including the destroyer PNS Khaibar and minesweeper PNS Muhafiz, and destroying fuel tanks at Karachi Harbour. Uday Bhaskar, a former commodore in the Indian Navy, said the navy played a pivotal role in India’s 1971 victory. “The naval role enabled the final outcome on land,” Bhaskar, the current director of the Society for Policy Studies, an independent think tank based in New Delhi, told Al Jazeera. Pakistan also suffered the loss of its prized submarine Ghazi, which sank while laying mines near Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, home to India’s Eastern Naval Command. The one major victory for the Pakistani Navy was its torpedoing of the Indian frigate INS Khukri using its submarine Hangor, which killed more than 170 Indian sailors. Qazi, who is also an assistant professor at Lahore’s Punjab University, said that the Indian Navy replicated the Pakistani playbook from the 1965 war in the way it surprised the Pakistan Navy. “India caused a heavy blow to Pakistan and our naval capabilities were severely dented,” he said. Since the 1971 war, India and Pakistan have approached different naval strategies. Obaidullah, who retired from the Pakistan Navy in 2008, said that India has tried to build a “blue water navy” capable of projecting power across oceans. The idea: “To assert its dominance in [the] Indian Ocean,” he said. Qazi, the maritime expert, agreed, saying that the Indian Navy has focused not just on building a numerical advantage in its naval assets but also on partnerships with nations such as Russia, which have helped it develop a powerful fleet. “The Indian Navy now has the ability to conduct missions that can cover long distances, all the way down to Mauritius near southern Africa, or even some adventures in [the] Pacific Ocean as well,” he said. As the world’s fifth-largest economy, India has invested heavily in naval development. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a London-based research institute focusing on defence and security issues, India has 29 principal surface combat vessels, including two aircraft carriers, 12 destroyers, 15 frigates and 18 submarines, of which two are nuclear-powered. Pakistan, by contrast, has prioritised its land and air forces. Its navy has grown more slowly, mainly through cooperation with China and Turkiye. It regularly holds major naval exercises with its allies, with the last one taking place in February this year. IISS data shows that Pakistan’s navy lacks aircraft carriers and destroyers but includes 11 frigates, eight submarines and at least 21 patrol vessels. Obaidullah explained that Pakistan’s naval ambitions and objectives are very different from those of India. “India aims to project global power. We have a defensive navy to secure our sea lines of communication and deter aggression,” the former naval officer said. With more than 95 percent of Pakistan’s trade sea-based, protecting maritime routes is its top priority. Maritime expert Qazi also said that the Pakistani Navy is focused on defending its “littoral zones”. From a naval perspective, a “littoral zone” is a critically important area close to coastlines, unlike the open ocean’s “blue water” expanse. It is within this space that countries engage in coastal defence. “Pakistan has a small economy, and we do not have blue water ambitions. We do not have the capacity to build a fleet, nor [do] we need one,” Qazi said. “Our defence paradigm is about defending our coastlines, and for that, we have our submarines, which carry cruise missiles.” The latest conflict saw both conventional and modern warfare, including drones used to strike deep inside each other’s territory. But Singh’s May 30 remarks suggest a more assertive naval posture in future conflicts, say analysts. “If Pakistan does any unholy act this time, it is possible that the opening will be done by our navy,” Singh said during his speech on May 30. Bhaskar, the Indian commodore who retired in 2007, agreed that future conflicts could see naval escalation. “If another military conflict escalates, the probability of navies being actively involved is high,” he said. Bashir Ali Abbas, a New Delhi-based maritime affairs expert and former fellow at the Stimson Center, in Washington, DC, said that naval platforms inherently serve multiple roles. Abbas said that warships and submarines can switch from patrolling missions or exercises to operational missions on short notice. But that would carry risks of its own. “Should the Indian Navy play a substantial role in operations against Pakistan following the next crisis, then the element of escalation control practically disappears. Any ship-on-ship, or ship-on-land engagement will imply that India and Pakistan are at war,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that the risk of inadvertent nuclear escalation is also potentially highest in the nuclear domain. Qazi, however, said that Singh’s statement was ambiguous about whether the Indian Navy would engage in surveillance or aggression. Any attack on Karachi, Pakistan’s economic hub, would provoke a strong response, the Lahore-based analyst said. “I believe India will choose to play hide and seek like it did this time,” Qazi said. But he added that there was a “high probability” that India could attack Pakistan’s naval installations on land, including its planes and radar stations. And that, he said, was an “alarming possibility”.","islamabad pakistan indian minister defence rajnath singh visit indian navy aircraft carrier ins vikrant may nearly three week ceasefire announce

"Pakistan ramps up defence spending by 20 percent after India conflict","Defence spending surges in Islamabad’s new budget, even as overall expenditures shrink.","Published On 10 Jun 202510 Jun 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/10/pakistan-ramps-up-defence-spending-by-20-percent-after-india-conflict","tag/india-pakistan-tensions/","Pakistan has announced a major boost to defence spending in its new budget, just weeks after coming to the brink of a fifth war with archrival India. The budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026, announced by the government on Tuesday, ramps up defence spending to 2.55 trillion rupees ($9bn), up 20 percent from the current fiscal year, which ends this month. The hike in defence expenditures comes amid a cut in overall spending, which is shrinking by 7 percent to 17.57 trillion rupees ($62bn). The budget reflects Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s goals of spurring growth while boosting Pakistan’s military in the wake of the most serious conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in nearly three decades. The bitter foes attacked each other with fighter jets, missiles, drones and artillery for several days in May before a ceasefire was declared.    The hostilities were triggered by a deadly attack by gunmen in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22, which India accused Pakistan of supporting. Pakistan denied any role in the attack. A 20 percent boost in defence spending had been expected by economists, who said it would likely be offset by cuts in development spending, the Reuters news agency reported. India’s defence spending in its 2025-2026 fiscal year, running from April to March, was set at $78.7bn, up nearly 10 percent from the previous year, and it has indicated it will ramp up its spending further in future budgets.","pakistan announce major boost defence spend new budget just week come brink war archrival india budget fiscal year announce government tuesday ramp defence spend trillion rupee bn percent current fiscal year end month hike defence expenditure come amid cut overall spend shrink percent trillion rupee bn budget reflect prime minister shehbaz sharif goal spur growth boost pakistan military wake serious conflict nuclear arm neighbour nearly three decade bitter foe attack fighter jet missile drone artillery several day may ceasefire declare hostility trigger deadly attack gunman pahalgam indian administer kashmir april india accuse pakistan support pakistan deny role attack percent boost defence spend expect economist say likely offset cut development spend reuters news agency report india defence spend fiscal year run april march set bn nearly percent previous year indicate ramp spend future budget"
"India-Pakistan conflict claims an unlikely victim: Himalayan pink salt","The recent trade ban comes on the heels of an armed attack in Kashmir in which gunmen killed 26 people.","Published On 9 Jun 20259 Jun 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/6/9/india-pakistan-conflict-claims-an-unlikely-victim-himalayan-pink-salt","tag/india-pakistan-tensions/","For the past three decades, Vipan Kumar has been importing Himalayan pink salt from Pakistan to sell in India. However, New Delhi banned the import of all Pakistani goods, including those routed through third countries, after the killing of 26 people, mostly Indian tourists, in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir in April. Kumar, the 50-year-old trader based in Amritsar in Punjab, the spiritual hub of Sikhs in India, told Al Jazeera that the ban has brought his business to a screeching halt. Kumar says he typically sold 2,000 to 2,500 tonnes of pink salt every quarter. “The profit margin is very thin, but still, the business is feasible because of the bulk sales. But the ban has completely halted the pink salt business. We don’t know when the situation would turn normal,” he told Al Jazeera. Himalayan pink salt has a pinkish tint due to a trace of minerals, including iron, and is used in cooking, decorative lamps and spa treatments. Hindus also prefer to use this salt during their religious fasts as it is a non-marine salt. The Himalayan pink salt is mined at the Khewra Salt Mine in the Punjab province of Pakistan, the second-largest salt mine in the world after the Sifto Salt Mine in Ontario, Canada. Khewra is located about 250km (155 miles) from the city of Lahore, which also at times lends its name to the pink salt – Lahori namak, which is Hindi for salt. The salt mine contains about 82 million metric tonnes of salt, and 0.36 million metric tonnes are extracted every year. About 70 percent of the salt is used for industrial purposes, and the rest is for edible use. “The mine is very scenic and attracts several thousand tourists every year,” Fahad Ali, a journalist who lives close to the mine, told Al Jazeera. It has approximately 30 salt processing units, where the huge rock salt boulders are hand-mined and loaded on trucks before being dispatched, he said. The salt is exported in a raw form to India, where importers process, grind and pack it for sale.    India mostly depends on Pakistan for this pink salt. But after the Pahalgam killings, India announced an end to all trade with Pakistan, which reciprocated the ban. The halt in trade was one of a series of diplomatic and economic tit-for-tat measures the neighbours took against each other before an intense four-day exchange of missiles and drones, which took the two countries to the cusp of a full-fledged war. On May 10, they stepped back from the brink, agreeing to a truce. However, the trade ban remains in place. Salt traders in India told Al Jazeera that the current pause in imports has started to hamper their business as prices are starting to rise. “It has been barely over a month since the announcement of the ban, and prices have already gone up,” said Gurveen Singh, an Amritsar-based trader, who blamed traders with existing stocks for selling them at higher prices. “The salt, which was sold in the retail market for 45 rupees to 50 rupees per kilogramme [$0.53 to $0.58] before the ban is now being sold for at least 60 rupees per kilogramme [$0.70],” Singh said. In some places, the price is even higher. In Kolkata this week, pink salt was being sold in markets for between 70 and 80 rupees per kg [$0.82 to $0.93]. “We have no idea when the situation would return to normal. There would be complete crisis once the stocks get exhausted,” he said. The rates, however, go up even more on the other side of India, in the east, due to the cost of transporting the salt from Amritsar. Traders in Kolkata told Al Jazeera that the prices of the salt have gone up by 15-20 percent in the city, but that has not yet hampered demand. “The Himalayan rock salt remains in huge demand across the year, especially during festivals when people remain on fast and prefer the pink salt over the marine salt that is produced in India,” said Sanjay Agarwal, a manager in a private firm that deals in pink salt. Dinobondhu Mukherjee, a salt trader in Kolkata, said that the government should look for an alternative country to procure this salt. “The relations between the two countries are usually strained, and that affects the trade. Our government should look for alternative countries to procure the salt so that the supply chain is never disrupted,” Mukherjee told Al Jazeera. Pakistani exporters, however, said that the Indian ban would have a “positive impact” on their trade. Indian traders, they said, brand their salt as their own to sell on the international market at higher prices. “The recent ban would help us to expand further as it would wipe off the competition from India,” Faizan Panjwani, the chief operating officer of the Karachi-based RM Salt, told Al Jazeera. “Undoubtedly, India is a big market and has a lot of potential, but we want to send the salt by doing value-addition and not in raw form. Our salt is already in huge demand globally,” he said.    Trade between the two countries has been decreasing since a 2019 attack on security forces in Pulwama, in Indian-administered Kashmir, in which 40 security personnel were killed. In response, India revoked the non-discriminatory market status – better known as the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status – it had granted to Pakistan, which had ensured equal treatment between the trade partners. It also imposed heavy tariffs of 200 percent on imports from Pakistan. According to India’s Ministry of Commerce, the country’s exports to Pakistan from April 2024 to January 2025 stood at $447.7m, while Pakistan’s exports to India during the same period were a paltry $420,000. In 2024, India imported about 642 metric tonnes of pink salt, which was far lower than the 74,457 metric tonnes imported in 2018 – largely as a result of the high tariffs. Prior to the latest ban, India’s major exports to Pakistan included cotton, organic chemicals, spices, food products, pharmaceuticals, plastic articles and dairy products. India normally imports copper articles, raw cotton, fruits, salt, minerals and some speciality chemicals from Pakistan. “The implementation of the heavy-duty had raised the import price of the salt from 3.50 rupees [$0.041] per kilogramme to 24.50 rupees [$0.29] per kilogramme in 2019, even though the salt was being routed from the third country like Dubai,” trader Kumar told Al Jazeera. “Still, it had not impacted our business as the demand was too high, and buyers were ready to pay the price. But the government, this time, has also prohibited the entry of Pakistani goods from any third country, which has brought the supply to a complete standstill,” he said. One unusual industry that is being hurt by the ban is lamps made from the Himalayan pink rock salt that are used as decorative lights and even tout unproven claims of being air purifiers. “We have to look for an alternative country if the supply of rock salt doesn’t come from Pakistan,” said Global Aroma founder Deep, who uses a single name. “The prices of the lamps had already increased after the imposition of a 200 percent tariff in 2019, and the procurement from any other country will lead to further escalation of cost.”","past three decade vipan kumar import himalayan pink salt pakistan sell india however new delhi ban import pakistani good include route country kill people mostly indian tourist pahalgam indian administer kashmir april kumar year old trader base amritsar punjab spiritual hub sikh india tell al jazeera ban bring business screech halt kumar say typically sell tonne pink salt every quarter profit margin thin still business feasible bulk sale ban completely halt pink salt business don know situation turn normal tell al jazeera himalayan pink salt pinkish tint due trace mineral include iron use cook decorative lamp spa treatment hindu also prefer use salt religious fast non marine salt himalayan pink salt mine khewra salt mine punjab province pakistan large salt mine world sifto salt mine ontario canada khewra locate km mile city lahore also time lend name pink salt lahori namak hindi salt salt mine contain million metric tonne salt million metric tonne extract every year percent salt use industrial purpose rest edible use mine scenic attract several thousand tourist every year fahad ali journalist life close mine tell al jazeera approximately salt process unit huge rock salt boulder hand mine load truck dispatch say salt export raw form india importer process grind pack sale india mostly depend pakistan pink salt pahalgam killing india announce end trade pakistan reciprocate ban halt trade one series diplomatic economic tit tat measure neighbour take intense four day exchange missile drone take two country cusp full fledge war may step back brink agree truce however trade ban remain place salt trader india tell al jazeera current pause import start hamper business price start rise barely month since announcement ban price already go say gurveen singh amritsar base trader blame trader exist stock sell high price salt sell retail market rupee rupee per kilogramme ban now sell less rupee per kilogramme singh say place price even high kolkata week pink salt sell market rupee per kg idea situation return normal complete crisis stock get exhaust say rate however go even side india east due cost transport salt amritsar trader kolkata tell al jazeera price salt go percent city yet hamper demand himalayan rock salt remain huge demand across year especially festival people remain fast prefer pink salt marine salt produce india say sanjay agarwal manager private firm deal pink salt dinobondhu mukherjee salt trader kolkata say government look alternative country procure salt relation two country usually strain affect trade government look alternative country procure salt supply chain never disrupt mukherjee tell al jazeera pakistani exporter however say indian ban positive impact trade indian trader say brand salt sell international market high price recent ban help us expand wipe competition india faizan panjwani chief operate officer karachi base rm salt tell al jazeera undoubtedly india big market lot potential want send salt value addition raw form salt already huge demand globally say trade two country decrease since attack security force pulwama indian administer kashmir security personnel kill response india revoke non discriminatory market status good know favour nation mfn status grant pakistan ensure equal treatment trade partner also impose heavy tariff percent import pakistan accord india ministry commerce country export pakistan april january stand be pakistan export india period paltry india import metric tonne pink salt far low metric tonne import largely result high tariff prior late ban india major export pakistan include cotton organic chemical spice food product pharmaceutical plastic article dairy product india normally import copper article raw cotton fruit salt mineral speciality chemical pakistan implementation heavy duty raise import price salt rupee per kilogramme rupee per kilogramme even though salt route country like dubai trader kumar tell al jazeera still impact business demand high buyer ready pay price government time also prohibit entry pakistani good country bring supply complete standstill say one unusual industry hurt ban lamp make himalayan pink rock salt use decorative light even tout unproven claim air purifier look alternative country supply rock salt doesn come pakistan say global aroma founder deep use single name price lamp already increase imposition percent tariff procurement country lead escalation cost"

"India general admits jet losses in clash with Pakistan: Here’s what he said","Anil Chauhan, India’s chief of defence staff, says India experienced losses in the air but denies six planes downed.","Published On 1 Jun 20251 Jun 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/1/india-general-admits-jet-losses-in-clash-with-pakistan-heres-what-he-said","tag/india-pakistan-tensions/","General Anil Chauhan, India’s chief of defence staff, has admitted that an unspecified number of its jets were shot down during its conflict with Pakistan last month. The acknowledgement of aerial losses by the country’s highest-ranking general comes weeks after the two South Asian neighbours were engaged in their heaviest fighting in decades, which involved fighter planes and cruise missiles. Indian officials had previously refused to confirm or deny Pakistani claims of downing Indian jets. The conflict was triggered after armed men killed 26 tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Pahalgam town on April 22. India’s first official admission of a loss of fighter jets came during Chauhan’s interviews on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore. India carried out strikes on what it called “terror infrastructure” in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on May 7 in retaliation for the Pahalgam attack. India blamed armed groups backed by Pakistan for the April 22 attack. An armed group called The Resistance Front (TRF) claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam killings. India accused TRF of being an offshoot of the Pakistan-based armed group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Pakistan denied involvement, condemning the Pahalgam attack and calling for a neutral investigation. India claimed to have targeted at least six cities in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on the first day of the conflict. Pakistan initially asserted that it had downed six Indian jets in retaliation. But a senior Pakistan official later told Al Jazeera that five Indian aircraft were shot down in the aerial battle. India did not confirm or deny the Pakistani claims. “Losses are a part of combat,” Air Marshal AK Bharti, India’s director general of air operations, said at a news conference on May 11. The Indian embassy in China called reports of the downing of jets “disinformation”. After that, tit-for-tat cross-border attacks across the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border between India- and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, rattled the region, renewing fears of a nuclear war. On May 10, United States President Donald Trump announced that the two countries had reached a ceasefire, potentially averting a “nuclear disaster”. India and Pakistan have given competing claims on casualties in the fighting, but more than 70 people were killed on both sides. Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full but administer only parts of the Muslim-majority Himalayan territory. Here is what Chauhan said in recent interviews with the Reuters news agency and Bloomberg TV: Chauhan admitted that India suffered air losses on the first day of fighting without providing details. In an interview with Reuters, he said: “What was important is why did these losses occur and what we’ll do after that.” The general said, after the losses, the Indian army “rectified tactics” and then went back on May 7, 8 and 10 “in large numbers to hit airbases deep inside Pakistan, penetrated all their air defences with impunity, carried out precision strikes”. He added that the Indian air force “flew all types of aircraft with all types of ordnances” on May 10. Islamabad acknowledged that its airbases suffered minimal losses but denied that it had lost any planes. When a Bloomberg reporter asked Chauhan about Pakistan’s claims that six Indian jets were downed, Chauhan responded that this information was incorrect. He went on to say: “What is important is … not the jets being downed but why they were downed.” Some media outlets inferred that his statement appeared to imply that many jets were lost in the aerial battle. The general did not provide details about the number of jets downed or specifics about what these rectified tactics were. The Pakistani military said India did not fly its jets in the conflict again after suffering air losses. Media reports suggested that some attacks were near Pakistan’s nuclear sites, but the nuclear infrastructure itself was not a target. “Most of the strikes were delivered with pinpoint accuracy, some even to a metre [3.3ft] to whatever was our selected mean point of impact,” Chauhan told Reuters. He had previously provided assurances that India was not considering using nuclear weapons during the conflict. The chairman of Pakistan’s joint chiefs of staff, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, has done the same for his country. “I think there’s a lot of space before that nuclear threshold is crossed, a lot of signalling before that. I think nothing like that happened. There’s a lot of space for conventional operations which has been created, and this will be the new norm,” Chauhan said. He added that on both sides, the most “rational people are in uniform” during conflict because they understand the consequences of “this kind of conflict”. “I found both sides displaying a lot of rationality in their thoughts as well as actions. So why should we assume that in the nuclear domain there will be irrationality on someone else’s part?” Chauhan said while Pakistan enjoys a close alliance with China, there was no sign that Beijing helped Islamabad during the conflict. China sits on India’s northern and northeastern borders, and controls a barely inhabited northeastern zone in Kashmir called Aksai Chin. “We didn’t find any unusual activity in the operational or tactical depth of our northern borders, and things were generally all right,” Chauhan said. When asked whether China provided Pakistan with intelligence information such as satellite imagery, the Indian general said such information is commercially available, and Pakistan could have obtained it from China or other sources. However, Chauhan said “almost 80 percent of the equipment” in Pakistan has been procured from China in the past few years. From 2020 to 2025, China supplied 81 percent of Pakistan’s arms imports, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Chinese jets got a boost after media reports said Pakistan used Chinese-manufactured J-10C fighters in the air battle. The Chinese government did not officially confirm that the J-10C jets were used to down Indian planes, but state broadcaster CCTV posted on social media on May 17 that the jets achieved actual combat results for the first time. Chauhan said while hostilities have ceased, India would “respond precisely and decisively should there be any further terror attacks emanating from Pakistan”. He added that this will be a new normal for India. “So that has its own dynamics as far [as] the armed forces are concerned. It will require us to be prepared 24/7.” The president of the main opposition Indian National Congress party said Chauhan’s admission warrants a review of India’s defence preparedness. “There are some very important questions which need to be asked. These can only be asked if a Special Session of the Parliament is immediately convened,” Mallikarjun Kharge wrote in an X post on Saturday. Referring to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he added: “The Modi Govt has misled the nation. The fog of war is now clearing.” “We salute [the Indian military’s] resolute courage and bravery,” Kharge said. “However, a comprehensive strategic review is the need of the hour.” The Congress has called the Pahalgam attack a “security and intelligence failure” and sought accountability, given that Indian-administered Kashmir is directly governed from New Delhi. But Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, DC, said Chauhan’s interviews do not “change the war narrative in a big way”. “It confirms the jet losses that so many observers had assumed while emphasising the battlefield achievements of India that are already well known,” Kugelman told Al Jazeera. Still, the analyst said, the acknowledgement that Indian planes were downed “has triggered an uncomfortable question for New Delhi, and one that even some government supporters are posing: Why did it take so long to acknowledge a loss that [New] Delhi has shrugged off as inconsequential?” Kugelman argued, “India’s silence ended up emboldening Pakistan’s narrative and put India on the defensive and having to face awkward questions from global media.” “One can argue that had [New] Delhi earlier on acknowledged the jet losses while in the same breath focusing attention on its achievements, it would not have to be in reactive and defensive mode now on this issue,” he said.","general anil chauhan india chief defence staff admit unspecified numb jet shoot conflict pakistan last month

"India top general admits aerial ‘losses’ in recent conflict with Pakistan","General Anil Chauhan appears to confirm India lost at least one jet during conflict with Pakistan earlier this month.","Published On 31 May 202531 May 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/31/india-top-general-admits-losses-in-recent-conflict-with-pakistan","tag/india-pakistan-tensions/","India’s chief of defence staff says the country suffered initial losses in the air during a recent military conflict with neighbouring Pakistan, but declined to give details. “What was important is, why did these losses occur, and what we will do after that,” General Anil Chauhan told the Reuters news agency on Saturday on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore. India and Pakistan were engaged in a four-day conflict this month, their worst standoff since 1999, before a ceasefire was agreed on May 10. More than 70 people were killed in missile, drone and artillery fire on both sides, but there are competing claims on the casualties. India says more than 100 “terrorists” were killed in its “precision strikes” on several “terror camps” across Pakistan, which rejects the claim, saying more than 30 Pakistani civilians were killed in the Indian attacks. New Delhi, meanwhile, says nearly two dozen civilians were killed on the Indian side, most of them in Indian-administered Kashmir, along the disputed border.    The fighting between the two nuclear powers was triggered by an attack on tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22 that killed 26 people, almost all of them tourists. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for supporting the armed group behind the attack, an allegation Islamabad denied. During their conflict, Pakistan had also claimed to have downed at least five Indian military jets, including at least three Rafale fighters. But Chauhan on Saturday dismissed it as “absolutely incorrect”, confirming his country had lost at least one aircraft. “I think what is important is that, not the jet being down, but why they were being down,” he told Bloomberg TV in a separate interview in Singapore. On May 11, a day after the ceasefire, India’s Air Marshal AK Bharti told reporters in New Delhi that “all our pilots are back home”, adding that “we are in a combat scenario, and that losses are a part of combat”. Chauhan said on Saturday India switched tactics after suffering losses in the air on the first day of conflict and established a decisive advantage. “So we rectified tactics and then went back on the [May] 7th, 8th and 10th in large numbers to hit airbases deep inside Pakistan, penetrated all their air defences with impunity, carried out precision strikes,” he said. Islamabad has denied it suffered any losses of planes but has acknowledged its airbases suffered some hits, although losses were minimal. Chauhan said while the fighting had ceased, the Indian government had made it clear that it would respond “precisely and decisively should there be any further terror attacks emanating from Pakistan”. “So that has its own dynamics as far [as] the armed forces are concerned. It will require us to be prepared 24/7,” he said. Chauhan also said that although Pakistan is closely allied with China, which borders India in the north and the northeast, there was no sign of any actual help from Beijing during the conflict. “While this was unfolding from [April] 22nd onwards, we didn’t find any unusual activity in the operational or tactical depth of our northern borders, and things were generally all right,” he told Reuters. Asked whether China may have provided any satellite imagery or other real-time intelligence to Pakistan during the conflict, Chauhan said such imagery was commercially available and could have been procured from China as well as other sources.","india chief defence staff say country suffer initial loss air recent military conflict neighbour pakistan decline give detail important loss occur general anil chauhan tell reuters news agency saturday sideline shangri la dialogue security forum singapore india pakistan engage four day conflict month bad standoff since ceasefire agree may people kill missile drone artillery fire side compete claim casualty india say terrorist kill precision strike several terror camp across pakistan reject claim say pakistani civilian kill indian attack new delhi meanwhile say nearly two dozen civilian kill indian side indian administer kashmir along dispute border fight two nuclear power trigger attack tourist pahalgam indian administer kashmir april kill people almost tourist new delhi blame pakistan support arm group behind attack allegation islamabad deny conflict pakistan also claim down less five indian military jet include less three rafale fighter chauhan saturday dismiss absolutely incorrect confirm country lose less one aircraft think important jet tell bloomberg tv separate interview singapore may day ceasefire india air marshal ak bharti tell reporter new delhi pilot back home add combat scenario loss part combat chauhan say saturday india switch tactic suffer loss air first day conflict establish decisive advantage rectify tactic go back may th th th large number hit airbases deep inside pakistan penetrate air defence impunity carry precision strike say islamabad deny suffer loss plane acknowledge airbases suffer hit although loss minimal chauhan say fight cease indian government make clear respond precisely decisively terror attack emanate pakistan dynamic far arm force concern require us prepare say chauhan also say although pakistan closely ally china border india north northeast sign actual help beijing conflict unfold april nd onward didn find unusual activity operational tactical depth northern border thing generally right tell reuters ask whether china may provide satellite imagery real time intelligence pakistan conflict chauhan say imagery commercially available procure china good source"
"Pakistan pitches ‘responsible’ image as diplomatic war with India heats up","India and Pakistan have shifted from armed confrontation to a diplomatic offensive, seeking to shape global opinion.","Published On 29 May 202529 May 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/29/ceasefire-holds-as-india-pakistan-tensions-shift-to-diplomacy","tag/india-pakistan-tensions/","Islamabad, Pakistan – Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited Azerbaijan in February, and Turkiye only a month ago, in April. Yet, this week, he was back in both countries, as part of a five-day, four-nation diplomatic blitzkrieg also including stops in Iran and Tajikistan, where Sharif will hold talks on Thursday and Friday. And he isn’t alone: Sharif is being accompanied by Army Chief Asim Munir – recently promoted to Pakistan’s only second-ever field marshal – and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar. Their destinations might be familiar, but the context has changed dramatically since Sharif’s previous visits. More than two weeks after a four-day standoff between Pakistan and India – during which they exchanged missile and drone attacks – diplomacy has become the new battlefront between the South Asian neighbours. India has launched a global diplomatic campaign, sending delegations to more than 30 countries, accusing Pakistan of supporting “terrorist groups” responsible for attacks in India and Indian-administered Kashmir. “We want to exhort the world to hold those responsible for cross-border terrorism accountable, those who have practiced this for 40 years against India, that is Pakistan. Their actions need to be called out,” said Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External Affairs, last week. On April 22, gunmen killed 26 people, most of them tourists, in Pahalgam, a hill resort in Indian-administered Kashmir, in the worst such attack on civilians in years. India blamed the killings on The Resistance Front (TRF), which it alleges is linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a Pakistan-based group designated as a “terrorist” entity by the United Nations. New Delhi accused Islamabad of complicity in the attacks. Pakistan denied the allegations, calling for a “transparent, credible, independent” investigation. Then, on May 7, India launched a series of missiles aimed at what it said was “terrorist infrastructure” in parts of Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Islamabad insisted that the missiles struck civilians, mosques and schools. More than 50 people, including at least 11 security personnel, were killed in the Indian missile attacks. This was followed by drone incursions and, on May 10, both sides fired missiles at each other’s military bases, as they stood on the brink of a full-fledged war before they agreed to a ceasefire that the United States says it brokered. Now, Pakistan, say officials and analysts, is looking to flip India’s narrative before the world – projecting itself as an advocate of peace and stability in South Asia, and New Delhi as the aggressor looking to stoke tensions.  On Wednesday, Sharif expressed willingness to engage in dialogue with India on “all matters” if India reciprocates “in all sincerity”. Speaking at a trilateral summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan, Sharif said trade could resume if India cooperated on all issues, including “counterterrorism”. “I have said in all humility that we want peace in the region, and that requires talks on the table on issues which need urgent attention and amicable resolution, that is the issue of Kashmir, according to the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council, and as per the aspirations of the people of Kashmir,” he said. Kashmir, a picturesque valley in the northeastern subcontinent, remains the root of conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations since their independence in 1947. A 1948 UN resolution called for a plebiscite to determine Kashmir’s future, but eight decades later, it has yet to take place. India and Pakistan each administer parts of Kashmir, while China controls two small regions. India claims the entire territory; Pakistan claims the portion administered by India, but not the areas held by Pakistan’s ally, China. But there are other motivations driving Pakistan’s diplomatic outreach, say officials and experts. India’s diplomatic delegations that are currently touring the world include members from various political parties, including the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Indian National Congress (INC), projecting a unified stance. In contrast, Pakistan’s current mission is led by top state officials, including Sharif and army chief Munir, widely considered the most powerful figure in the country.  The trip also reflects strategic alignment, say analysts. Turkiye, whose drones were used by Pakistan in the recent conflict, is a key defence partner. “Pakistan’s defence cooperation with Turkey is especially deep,” said Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the University at Albany. “Evidence suggests several Turkish-origin systems were used in this recent clash, with varying levels of effectiveness, so there is much to talk about between the two,” he told Al Jazeera. Khurram Dastgir Khan, a former federal minister for foreign affairs and defence, is part of a Pakistani delegation set to visit the US, United Kingdom and European Union headquarters in Brussels next month. He said the current trip by Sharif, Munir and Dar is at least partly about highlighting Pakistan’s capacity to wage a modern war against a larger adversary. “There is immense interest in how Pakistan fought the recent war,” Khan said. “There are countries deeply interested in learning the details, what capabilities Pakistan used and what Indians had,” he added. “This opens new strategic possibilities for Pakistan’s defence forces to provide training to others. We are battle-tested. This makes us highly sought after, not just in the region but globally.” Pakistan relied heavily on Chinese-supplied weaponry, including the fighter jets and missiles it deployed against India, and the air defence systems it used to defend itself from Indian missiles. Though both countries claimed victory after the conflict, the battle over narratives has since raged across social media and public forums. Pakistan claims to have downed six Indian jets, a claim neither confirmed nor denied by India, while Indian missiles penetrated deep into Pakistani territory, revealing vulnerabilities in Pakistan’s air defences. India has also suspended the six-decade-old Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a critical water-sharing agreement that is vital to Pakistan. Recently, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged Pakistanis to reject “terrorism”. “Live a life of peace, eat your bread or choose my bullet,” Modi said, during a speech in India’s Gujarat state. He also criticised the IWT as “badly negotiated”, claiming it disadvantaged India. Muhammad Shoaib, an academic and security analyst at Quaid-i-Azam University, said Modi’s remarks reflected “ultra-nationalism” and were targeted at a domestic audience. “The Indian diplomatic teams won’t likely focus on what Pakistan says. They will only implicate Pakistan for terrorism and build their case. Meanwhile, the Pakistani delegation will likely use Modi’s statements and international law regarding the IWT to bolster their arguments,” he told Al Jazeera. Khan, who is also a senior member of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN), the governing party which premier Sharif belongs to, said the upcoming diplomatic mission that he will be part of will focus on issues like India’s suspension of the IWT. “Our fundamental point is that Pakistan seeks to maintain lasting peace in South Asia, but three major hurdles are posed by Indian aggression,” he said. The first, according to Khan, is “Indian-sponsored terrorism” in Pakistan, in which, he claimed, more than 20 people have been killed over the past four years. India has been accused by the US and Canada of transnational assassinations. In January 2024, Pakistan also accused India of carrying out killings on its soil. India denies involvement. Pakistan also accuses India of backing separatist groups in its Balochistan province – again, an allegation that India rejects. “The second point is India’s utterly irresponsible suspension of the IWT,” Khan said. “Pakistan has rightly said that any step by India to stop our water will be treated as an act of war. This is something that can bring all the region in conflict and I believe that if India acquires capability to divert waters in next six to 10 years, and tries to do so, it will lead to a war,” Khan warned. The third issue, Khan said, is Pakistan’s concern over India’s “status as a responsible nuclear power”. In the past, New Delhi has frequently cited the nuclear proliferation facilitated by Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, as evidence that Islamabad cannot be trusted with the safe management of its nuclear weapons. But in recent days, India’s internal security minister, Amit Shah – widely viewed as the country’s second-most powerful leader after Modi – has confirmed that India used its homegrown BrahMos missile against Pakistan during the recent military escalation. The BrahMos, developed with Russia, is a supersonic cruise missile capable of Mach 3 – three times the speed of sound – and a range of 300 to 500km (200 to 300 miles). It can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads and be launched from land, air, or sea. Khan, who served as defence minister from 2017 to 2018, warned of “unimaginable consequences” from using such weapons. “Once the missile is in the air, you cannot know what payload it carries until it hits the target. This is very, very irresponsible,” he said. “India has already shown recklessness when it mistakenly fired a missile into our territory a few years ago.” Khan was referring to an incident in March 2022, when India fired a BrahMos “accidentally” into Pakistani territory, where it fell in the densely populated city of Mian Channu, roughly 500km (300 miles) south of capital Islamabad. India at the time acknowledged that accidental launch was due to a “technical malfunction” and later sacked three air force officials. While the conflict brought both countries to the edge of war, the ceasefire declared on May 10 has held, with troops gradually returning to peacetime positions. Shoaib, also a research fellow at George Mason University in the US, expressed cautious optimism. “Initiating hostilities is risky. No side wants to be seen as irresponsible. For that to break, it would take a major incident,” he said. Tughral Yamin, a former military officer and researcher in Islamabad, noted that while diplomacy offers no guarantees, the ceasefire could last. “India has seen that Pakistan is no cakewalk. It has both conventional and nuclear deterrence,” he told Al Jazeera. “Both sides will remain alert, and Pakistan must address weaknesses exposed in the standoff.” Clary added that while the India-Pakistan relationship remains fragile, history suggests that intense clashes are often followed by calmer periods. “It is reasonable for both countries and international observers to hope for the best but prepare for the worst over the next few months,” he said. But Khan, the former minister, questioned Modi’s comments after the military crisis, where the Indian PM said any attack on the country’s soil would now be seen as worthy of a military response, and that New Delhi would cease to draw any distinction between Pakistan’s military and non-state armed groups. “The new stated policy of the Indian government is to attack Pakistan even after minor incidents, without waiting for evidence. This puts the entire region on edge,” he said. “This trigger-happy policy should concern not just Pakistan, but the entire world.”","islamabad pakistan pakistan prime minister shehbaz sharif visit

"How is Pakistan raising money for a 20 percent hike in defence spending?","Pakistan hikes its defence budget by 20 percent after border clashes with India, economy remains reliant on IMF loans.","Published On 12 Jun 202512 Jun 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/12/how-is-pakistan-raising-money-for-a-20-percent-hike-in-defence-spending","tag/india-pakistan-tensions/","Islamabad, Pakistan – Pakistan has increased its defence spending by more than 20 percent – the most substantial hike in a decade – following last month’s military confrontation with neighbouring India. Presenting the annual federal budget on June 10, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb proposed an allocation of 2.55 trillion rupees ($9bn) for the country’s three armed services – the army, air force and navy – amounting to 1.97 percent of Pakistan’s gross domestic product (GDP), up from 1.7 percent in the previous budget. “The security situation in the country is precarious, and the armed forces have rendered commendable service in protecting the borders,” Aurangzeb said during his speech, as India has threatened to carry out strikes if armed groups carry out attacks on India or Indian-administered Kashmir. But analysts say that Islamabad will need to walk a fine balance in spending more on defence at a time when its fragile economy is under strict oversight from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and cuts in social sector expenditure could embolden the opposition. On May 7, India carried out missile strikes on what it called “terrorist infrastructure” in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir after blaming Islamabad for backing fighters responsible for the killing of 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Pahalgam town on April 22. Pakistan denied involvement in the Pahalgam attacks, demanding a “credible, transparent, independent” investigation. Islamabad said innocent civilians were killed in India’s attacks on May 7. Tensions escalated after the two nuclear-armed neighbours engaged in tit-for-tat missile and drone attacks over four days, primarily targeting each other’s military installations. By the time a ceasefire was announced by United States President Donald Trump on May 10, in excess of 70 people had been killed – more than 50 in Pakistan and at least 20 in India. Against that backdrop, Pakistan’s defence hike was expected, say analysts. India, which presented its budget before the conflict, also increased its defence spending to $78.7bn, a 9.5 percent rise from the previous year. But unlike India, Pakistan has more than a neighbour to keep an eye on: It also confronts pressure from the IMF.  The IMF approved a 37-month, $7bn loan programme for Pakistan last September, its 25th since 1958. The most recent tranche of $1.3bn was released in May this year, a day before the ceasefire between India and Pakistan took place. But in exchange, the global lender has been pressuring Pakistan to streamline its expenditure, reduce subsidies and improve the efficiency of its governance structures. Pakistan appears to have paid heed to those demands from the IMF. Even as its defence spending has gone up substantially, its overall budget for the next fiscal year has been reduced to 17.57 trillion rupees ($62bn), marking a 6.9 percent decrease from last year. The defence spending hike, while massive, is in line with growing defence allocation in recent years. The military’s budget has nearly doubled in the past five years. In fiscal year 2020-21, the allocation stood at 1.28 trillion rupees ($4.53bn). The army, long seen as the most powerful institution in Pakistan’s defence and political spheres, has received 1.17 trillion rupees ($4.1bn), accounting for nearly 46 percent of the total defence budget. The air force and navy received just more than 520 billion rupees ($1.8m) and 265.9 billion rupees ($941m), respectively. Pakistan’s military budget increase also reflects a broader global trend. A report published in April by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which specialises in conflict and arms control research, stated that global military expenditure reached $2.7 trillion in 2024, a 9.4 percent increase from the previous year and the “steepest year-on-year rise since the end of the Cold War”. Hina Shaikh, a Lahore-based economist with the International Growth Centre (IGC), said the increase in Pakistan was expected and reflects the government’s continued prioritisation of security amid geopolitical tensions and domestic instability. “While understandable from a strategic lens, this increase does come when economic recovery is just beginning to happen, but still fragile, inflation is easing and fiscal space is constrained,” she told Al Jazeera. Ali Hasanain, an economics professor at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), called the hike in defence spending both “inevitable and necessary” but warned against sacrificing long-term development. “The only way out of this dilemma for Pakistan is to undertake deep structural reforms of the sort which no government has shown a commitment to yet, so that both the economy and defence spending can stay robust over the medium and long terms,” Hasanain said. While most analysts agree that the defence spending hike is a fallout of the May conflict, a major challenge for the government is to fund it without compromising the social welfare, health, or education sectors. Due to Pakistan’s sizable external debt, recorded at $87.4bn according to the latest government figures, the largest share of the national budget is consumed by debt servicing, which stands at $29bn, which is almost 47 percent of total expenditure. In the budget announced on Tuesday, Pakistan’s government has cut subsidies. The budget also outlines plans to expand the tax base, removes exemptions, and introduces new taxes to raise public revenue. The opposition party of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan dubbed the budget “anti-people” and “crafted for the elite.” The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the opposition party said on Wednesday that the budget provided no real relief to the public, as government staff salary raises were low and agriculture, the mainstay of the country’s economy, witnessed decline. Sajid Amin Javed, a senior economist at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), said that the combination of a decline in the interest payments Pakistan owes its debtors this year, and the cut in subsidies had provided the government “some fiscal space”. Still, others highlighted that Pakistan’s defence spending, while the highest in South Asia as a percentage of GDP, has declined in relative terms compared to past decades as it has been forced to set money aside to repay loans. Hasanain of LUMS said that Pakistan now spends less, as a percentage of GDP, than countries like Singapore (2.8 percent), Greece (3.1 percent), Poland (4.2 percent), or the United States (3.4 percent), and nearly three times less than Saudi Arabia (7.3 percent), Russia (7.1 percent), or Israel (8.8 percent). But he pointed out that Pakistan also collects far less tax than most other countries, so the defence spending hike still eats up a giant chunk of the government’s revenue. “A low tax to GDP ratio means that defence spending is a bigger burden for the government in Pakistan than most other countries in the world.” The last few years have been deeply turbulent for Pakistan’s economy. Foreign reserves fell to just under $3bn in 2023, bringing the country of 250 million people to the brink of default. Foreign reserves have since risen to $11bn following IMF deals. Similarly, the Pakistani rupee, having lost more than 60 percent of its value against the US dollar over the last two years, has now stabilised between 280 and 282 rupees per dollar. Javed of SDPI says these indicators show Pakistan’s macroeconomic fundamentals are stabilising, but the public impact remains uncertain. “It is a budget of stabilisation, made in consultation with the IMF, to ensure that the country’s revenue, growth and fiscal deficit targets are met. But on the whole, it remains a traditional budget, with no deep-rooted structural changes or strategic change visible, at least for now,” he said. Economist Shaikh argued that the budget lacks inclusive or pro-poor reforms and shows limited investment in sectors like health and education. “This may be called a technocrat’s budget under IMF constraints, fiscally conservative, tax-heavy, and focused on short-term stabilisation. It is focused on restoring macroeconomic stability, controlling inflation, and building reserves,” she said. Hasanain, however, says that the IMF principally concerns itself with helping countries move back towards stability, and does not consider long-term, sustainable growth as its purview. “By cutting expenditures and running primary budget surpluses, the government is indeed moving out of the acute debt crisis it found itself in two years ago, but the larger project of correcting longstanding structural deficiencies is, despite receiving some lip service, largely neglected to date,” he said. “Given the lack of any serious political opposition, this excessive caution towards reform is deeply frustrating.”","islamabad pakistan pakistan increase defence spend percent substantial hike decade follow last month military confrontation neighbour india present annual federal budget june

"Are India and Pakistan preparing for a naval face-off in a future conflict?","Recent signals from both governments have underscored how their navies could play a central role in their next face-off.","Published On 11 Jun 202511 Jun 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/11/are-india-and-pakistan-preparing-for-a-naval-faceoff-in-a-future-conflict","tag/india-pakistan-tensions/","Islamabad, Pakistan – When Indian Minister of Defence Rajnath Singh visited the Indian Navy’s aircraft carrier INS Vikrant on May 30, nearly three weeks after a ceasefire was announced with Pakistan after a four-day conflict, he had stern words for Islamabad. Wearing an Indian Navy baseball cap, with his initial “R” emblazoned on it, Singh declared that Pakistan was fortunate the Indian Navy had not been called upon during the recent hostilities. “Despite remaining silent, the Indian Navy succeeded in tying down the Pakistani Army. Just imagine what will happen when someone who can keep a country’s army locked in a bottle, even by remaining silent, speaks up?” Singh said, standing in front of a Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jet on the deck of the 262-metre-long (860 feet) ship. Just two days later, on June 1, the Pakistan Navy issued a pointed response. In a message posted on X, it announced a two-day exercise, “focusing on countering sub-conventional and asymmetric threats across all major ports and harbours of Pakistan”. PN conducted 2-day Ex focusing on countering sub-conventional & asymmetric threats across all major ports & harbours of Pak, aimed at validating & refining Tactics, Techniques & Procedures to ensure robust defence of critical maritime infrastructure against asymmetric threats.1/3 pic.twitter.com/R1IsajwyBB — DGPR (Navy) (@dgprPaknavy) June 1, 2025   These symbolic shows of strength followed India’s “Operation Sindoor” and Pakistan’s “Operation Bunyan Marsoos“, the countries’ respective codenames for the four-day conflict that ended in a ceasefire on May 10. The standoff was triggered by an April 22 attack in Pahalgam, in Indian-administered Kashmir, in which 26 civilians, almost all tourists, were killed. India blamed armed groups allegedly backed by Pakistan, a charge Islamabad denied. On May 7, India launched missile strikes at multiple sites in Pakistan’s Punjab province and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, killing at least 51 people, including 11 soldiers and several children. Over the next three days, the two countries exchanged artillery and air power, hitting each other’s airbases. The 96 hours of conflict brought 1.6 billion people to the brink of war. But while the navies largely remained passive observers, they monitored each other’s movements – and were ready for action. Satellite imagery showed that the INS Vikrant moved towards Pakistan soon after the Pahalgam attack and remained deployed for four days in the Arabian Sea before returning to its base in Karnataka. Pakistan also mobilised its fleet, which was bolstered by the docking of a Turkish naval ship in Karachi on May 2. According to the Pakistani Navy, Turkish personnel engaged in “a series of professional interactions” with their counterparts. Now, even amid the current pause in military tensions, analysts say Singh’s remarks and Pakistan’s naval drills highlight the growing part that maritime forces could play in the next chapter of their conflict. This is a role the Indian and Pakistani navies are well-versed in. After independence from Britain in August 1947, India inherited two-thirds of British India’s naval assets. These saw no use during the first India-Pakistan war in 1947, over the contested Himalayan region of Kashmir. India and Pakistan both administer parts of Kashmir, along with China, which governs two thin strips. India claims all of Kashmir, while Pakistan claims all the parts not controlled by China, its ally. By the 1965 war, also over Kashmir, Pakistan had expanded its fleet with aid from the United States and United Kingdom, its Cold War allies. It had acquired Ghazi, a long-range submarine, giving it an edge over India, which lacked a submarine at the time, though it owned an aircraft carrier. Pakistan, to date, does not have an aircraft carrier. While the land war started on September 6, the Pakistan Navy joined the conflict on the night of September 7-8. A fleet of seven warships and submarine PNS Ghazi left Karachi harbour and made their way towards the Indian naval base of Dwarka in the western state of Gujarat, roughly 350km (217 miles) away. They were tasked with carrying out the “bombardment of Dwarka about midnight using 50 rounds per ship”, according to the Pakistan Navy’s official account, targeting the base’s radar and other installations. The selection of Dwarka was significant from a historical and strategic perspective. The city is home to one of the most sacred sites for Hindus, the Somnath Temple, on which the Pakistan Navy named its operation. Militarily, the radar installations in Dwarka were used to provide guidance to the Indian Air Force. Knocking them out would have made it harder for India to launch aerial attacks against Pakistani cities, especially Karachi. That, in turn, would have forced India to send out its warships from the nearby port of Bombay (now Mumbai) – and PNS Ghazi, the submarine, could have ambushed them. But the Pakistani plan only partly worked. Many Indian warships were under maintenance, and so the Indian Navy did not send them out to chase the Pakistani fleet. According to the Pakistan Navy’s accounts, after firing about 350 rounds, the operation ended in “four minutes” and all its ships returned safely. Syed Muhammad Obaidullah, a former commodore in the Pakistan Navy, recalled the attack. “We were able to send eight vessels, seven ships and a submarine – that surprised the Indians, as our ships targeted the radar station used to assist Indian planes,” Obaidullah told Al Jazeera. Muhammad Shareh Qazi, a Lahore-based maritime security expert, added that the operation was a tactical surprise, but did not lead to any gains in territory or of the maritime continental shelf. “All our ships returned safely, without resistance, but it was only an operational-level success for the PN, not a strategic one,” he said, referring to the Pakistan Navy. Official Indian Navy records claim that most of the shells fired by Pakistani ships caused no damage and remained unexploded. Anjali Ghosh, a professor of international relations at Jadavpur University, Kolkata, in her book India’s Foreign Policy, described the attack as “daring” but symbolic rather than strategically meaningful.  The 1971 war, fought over East Pakistan’s secession to become Bangladesh, saw more substantial naval engagements. India launched two operations – Trident and Python – which dealt major blows to Pakistan’s Navy, sinking several ships, including the destroyer PNS Khaibar and minesweeper PNS Muhafiz, and destroying fuel tanks at Karachi Harbour. Uday Bhaskar, a former commodore in the Indian Navy, said the navy played a pivotal role in India’s 1971 victory. “The naval role enabled the final outcome on land,” Bhaskar, the current director of the Society for Policy Studies, an independent think tank based in New Delhi, told Al Jazeera. Pakistan also suffered the loss of its prized submarine Ghazi, which sank while laying mines near Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, home to India’s Eastern Naval Command. The one major victory for the Pakistani Navy was its torpedoing of the Indian frigate INS Khukri using its submarine Hangor, which killed more than 170 Indian sailors. Qazi, who is also an assistant professor at Lahore’s Punjab University, said that the Indian Navy replicated the Pakistani playbook from the 1965 war in the way it surprised the Pakistan Navy. “India caused a heavy blow to Pakistan and our naval capabilities were severely dented,” he said. Since the 1971 war, India and Pakistan have approached different naval strategies. Obaidullah, who retired from the Pakistan Navy in 2008, said that India has tried to build a “blue water navy” capable of projecting power across oceans. The idea: “To assert its dominance in [the] Indian Ocean,” he said. Qazi, the maritime expert, agreed, saying that the Indian Navy has focused not just on building a numerical advantage in its naval assets but also on partnerships with nations such as Russia, which have helped it develop a powerful fleet. “The Indian Navy now has the ability to conduct missions that can cover long distances, all the way down to Mauritius near southern Africa, or even some adventures in [the] Pacific Ocean as well,” he said. As the world’s fifth-largest economy, India has invested heavily in naval development. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a London-based research institute focusing on defence and security issues, India has 29 principal surface combat vessels, including two aircraft carriers, 12 destroyers, 15 frigates and 18 submarines, of which two are nuclear-powered. Pakistan, by contrast, has prioritised its land and air forces. Its navy has grown more slowly, mainly through cooperation with China and Turkiye. It regularly holds major naval exercises with its allies, with the last one taking place in February this year. IISS data shows that Pakistan’s navy lacks aircraft carriers and destroyers but includes 11 frigates, eight submarines and at least 21 patrol vessels. Obaidullah explained that Pakistan’s naval ambitions and objectives are very different from those of India. “India aims to project global power. We have a defensive navy to secure our sea lines of communication and deter aggression,” the former naval officer said. With more than 95 percent of Pakistan’s trade sea-based, protecting maritime routes is its top priority. Maritime expert Qazi also said that the Pakistani Navy is focused on defending its “littoral zones”. From a naval perspective, a “littoral zone” is a critically important area close to coastlines, unlike the open ocean’s “blue water” expanse. It is within this space that countries engage in coastal defence. “Pakistan has a small economy, and we do not have blue water ambitions. We do not have the capacity to build a fleet, nor [do] we need one,” Qazi said. “Our defence paradigm is about defending our coastlines, and for that, we have our submarines, which carry cruise missiles.” The latest conflict saw both conventional and modern warfare, including drones used to strike deep inside each other’s territory. But Singh’s May 30 remarks suggest a more assertive naval posture in future conflicts, say analysts. “If Pakistan does any unholy act this time, it is possible that the opening will be done by our navy,” Singh said during his speech on May 30. Bhaskar, the Indian commodore who retired in 2007, agreed that future conflicts could see naval escalation. “If another military conflict escalates, the probability of navies being actively involved is high,” he said. Bashir Ali Abbas, a New Delhi-based maritime affairs expert and former fellow at the Stimson Center, in Washington, DC, said that naval platforms inherently serve multiple roles. Abbas said that warships and submarines can switch from patrolling missions or exercises to operational missions on short notice. But that would carry risks of its own. “Should the Indian Navy play a substantial role in operations against Pakistan following the next crisis, then the element of escalation control practically disappears. Any ship-on-ship, or ship-on-land engagement will imply that India and Pakistan are at war,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that the risk of inadvertent nuclear escalation is also potentially highest in the nuclear domain. Qazi, however, said that Singh’s statement was ambiguous about whether the Indian Navy would engage in surveillance or aggression. Any attack on Karachi, Pakistan’s economic hub, would provoke a strong response, the Lahore-based analyst said. “I believe India will choose to play hide and seek like it did this time,” Qazi said. But he added that there was a “high probability” that India could attack Pakistan’s naval installations on land, including its planes and radar stations. And that, he said, was an “alarming possibility”.","islamabad pakistan indian minister defence rajnath singh visit indian navy aircraft carrier ins vikrant may nearly three week ceasefire announce

"Pakistan ramps up defence spending by 20 percent after India conflict","Defence spending surges in Islamabad’s new budget, even as overall expenditures shrink.","Published On 10 Jun 202510 Jun 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/10/pakistan-ramps-up-defence-spending-by-20-percent-after-india-conflict","tag/india-pakistan-tensions/","Pakistan has announced a major boost to defence spending in its new budget, just weeks after coming to the brink of a fifth war with archrival India. The budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026, announced by the government on Tuesday, ramps up defence spending to 2.55 trillion rupees ($9bn), up 20 percent from the current fiscal year, which ends this month. The hike in defence expenditures comes amid a cut in overall spending, which is shrinking by 7 percent to 17.57 trillion rupees ($62bn). The budget reflects Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s goals of spurring growth while boosting Pakistan’s military in the wake of the most serious conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in nearly three decades. The bitter foes attacked each other with fighter jets, missiles, drones and artillery for several days in May before a ceasefire was declared.    The hostilities were triggered by a deadly attack by gunmen in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22, which India accused Pakistan of supporting. Pakistan denied any role in the attack. A 20 percent boost in defence spending had been expected by economists, who said it would likely be offset by cuts in development spending, the Reuters news agency reported. India’s defence spending in its 2025-2026 fiscal year, running from April to March, was set at $78.7bn, up nearly 10 percent from the previous year, and it has indicated it will ramp up its spending further in future budgets.","pakistan announce major boost defence spend new budget just week come brink war archrival india budget fiscal year announce government tuesday ramp defence spend trillion rupee bn percent current fiscal year end month hike defence expenditure come amid cut overall spend shrink percent trillion rupee bn budget reflect prime minister shehbaz sharif goal spur growth boost pakistan military wake serious conflict nuclear arm neighbour nearly three decade bitter foe attack fighter jet missile drone artillery several day may ceasefire declare hostility trigger deadly attack gunman pahalgam indian administer kashmir april india accuse pakistan support pakistan deny role attack percent boost defence spend expect economist say likely offset cut development spend reuters news agency report india defence spend fiscal year run april march set bn nearly percent previous year indicate ramp spend future budget"
"India-Pakistan conflict claims an unlikely victim: Himalayan pink salt","The recent trade ban comes on the heels of an armed attack in Kashmir in which gunmen killed 26 people.","Published On 9 Jun 20259 Jun 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/6/9/india-pakistan-conflict-claims-an-unlikely-victim-himalayan-pink-salt","tag/india-pakistan-tensions/","For the past three decades, Vipan Kumar has been importing Himalayan pink salt from Pakistan to sell in India. However, New Delhi banned the import of all Pakistani goods, including those routed through third countries, after the killing of 26 people, mostly Indian tourists, in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir in April. Kumar, the 50-year-old trader based in Amritsar in Punjab, the spiritual hub of Sikhs in India, told Al Jazeera that the ban has brought his business to a screeching halt. Kumar says he typically sold 2,000 to 2,500 tonnes of pink salt every quarter. “The profit margin is very thin, but still, the business is feasible because of the bulk sales. But the ban has completely halted the pink salt business. We don’t know when the situation would turn normal,” he told Al Jazeera. Himalayan pink salt has a pinkish tint due to a trace of minerals, including iron, and is used in cooking, decorative lamps and spa treatments. Hindus also prefer to use this salt during their religious fasts as it is a non-marine salt. The Himalayan pink salt is mined at the Khewra Salt Mine in the Punjab province of Pakistan, the second-largest salt mine in the world after the Sifto Salt Mine in Ontario, Canada. Khewra is located about 250km (155 miles) from the city of Lahore, which also at times lends its name to the pink salt – Lahori namak, which is Hindi for salt. The salt mine contains about 82 million metric tonnes of salt, and 0.36 million metric tonnes are extracted every year. About 70 percent of the salt is used for industrial purposes, and the rest is for edible use. “The mine is very scenic and attracts several thousand tourists every year,” Fahad Ali, a journalist who lives close to the mine, told Al Jazeera. It has approximately 30 salt processing units, where the huge rock salt boulders are hand-mined and loaded on trucks before being dispatched, he said. The salt is exported in a raw form to India, where importers process, grind and pack it for sale.    India mostly depends on Pakistan for this pink salt. But after the Pahalgam killings, India announced an end to all trade with Pakistan, which reciprocated the ban. The halt in trade was one of a series of diplomatic and economic tit-for-tat measures the neighbours took against each other before an intense four-day exchange of missiles and drones, which took the two countries to the cusp of a full-fledged war. On May 10, they stepped back from the brink, agreeing to a truce. However, the trade ban remains in place. Salt traders in India told Al Jazeera that the current pause in imports has started to hamper their business as prices are starting to rise. “It has been barely over a month since the announcement of the ban, and prices have already gone up,” said Gurveen Singh, an Amritsar-based trader, who blamed traders with existing stocks for selling them at higher prices. “The salt, which was sold in the retail market for 45 rupees to 50 rupees per kilogramme [$0.53 to $0.58] before the ban is now being sold for at least 60 rupees per kilogramme [$0.70],” Singh said. In some places, the price is even higher. In Kolkata this week, pink salt was being sold in markets for between 70 and 80 rupees per kg [$0.82 to $0.93]. “We have no idea when the situation would return to normal. There would be complete crisis once the stocks get exhausted,” he said. The rates, however, go up even more on the other side of India, in the east, due to the cost of transporting the salt from Amritsar. Traders in Kolkata told Al Jazeera that the prices of the salt have gone up by 15-20 percent in the city, but that has not yet hampered demand. “The Himalayan rock salt remains in huge demand across the year, especially during festivals when people remain on fast and prefer the pink salt over the marine salt that is produced in India,” said Sanjay Agarwal, a manager in a private firm that deals in pink salt. Dinobondhu Mukherjee, a salt trader in Kolkata, said that the government should look for an alternative country to procure this salt. “The relations between the two countries are usually strained, and that affects the trade. Our government should look for alternative countries to procure the salt so that the supply chain is never disrupted,” Mukherjee told Al Jazeera. Pakistani exporters, however, said that the Indian ban would have a “positive impact” on their trade. Indian traders, they said, brand their salt as their own to sell on the international market at higher prices. “The recent ban would help us to expand further as it would wipe off the competition from India,” Faizan Panjwani, the chief operating officer of the Karachi-based RM Salt, told Al Jazeera. “Undoubtedly, India is a big market and has a lot of potential, but we want to send the salt by doing value-addition and not in raw form. Our salt is already in huge demand globally,” he said.    Trade between the two countries has been decreasing since a 2019 attack on security forces in Pulwama, in Indian-administered Kashmir, in which 40 security personnel were killed. In response, India revoked the non-discriminatory market status – better known as the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status – it had granted to Pakistan, which had ensured equal treatment between the trade partners. It also imposed heavy tariffs of 200 percent on imports from Pakistan. According to India’s Ministry of Commerce, the country’s exports to Pakistan from April 2024 to January 2025 stood at $447.7m, while Pakistan’s exports to India during the same period were a paltry $420,000. In 2024, India imported about 642 metric tonnes of pink salt, which was far lower than the 74,457 metric tonnes imported in 2018 – largely as a result of the high tariffs. Prior to the latest ban, India’s major exports to Pakistan included cotton, organic chemicals, spices, food products, pharmaceuticals, plastic articles and dairy products. India normally imports copper articles, raw cotton, fruits, salt, minerals and some speciality chemicals from Pakistan. “The implementation of the heavy-duty had raised the import price of the salt from 3.50 rupees [$0.041] per kilogramme to 24.50 rupees [$0.29] per kilogramme in 2019, even though the salt was being routed from the third country like Dubai,” trader Kumar told Al Jazeera. “Still, it had not impacted our business as the demand was too high, and buyers were ready to pay the price. But the government, this time, has also prohibited the entry of Pakistani goods from any third country, which has brought the supply to a complete standstill,” he said. One unusual industry that is being hurt by the ban is lamps made from the Himalayan pink rock salt that are used as decorative lights and even tout unproven claims of being air purifiers. “We have to look for an alternative country if the supply of rock salt doesn’t come from Pakistan,” said Global Aroma founder Deep, who uses a single name. “The prices of the lamps had already increased after the imposition of a 200 percent tariff in 2019, and the procurement from any other country will lead to further escalation of cost.”","past three decade vipan kumar import himalayan pink salt pakistan sell india however new delhi ban import pakistani good include route country kill people mostly indian tourist pahalgam indian administer kashmir april kumar year old trader base amritsar punjab spiritual hub sikh india tell al jazeera ban bring business screech halt kumar say typically sell tonne pink salt every quarter profit margin thin still business feasible bulk sale ban completely halt pink salt business don know situation turn normal tell al jazeera himalayan pink salt pinkish tint due trace mineral include iron use cook decorative lamp spa treatment hindu also prefer use salt religious fast non marine salt himalayan pink salt mine khewra salt mine punjab province pakistan large salt mine world sifto salt mine ontario canada khewra locate km mile city lahore also time lend name pink salt lahori namak hindi salt salt mine contain million metric tonne salt million metric tonne extract every year percent salt use industrial purpose rest edible use mine scenic attract several thousand tourist every year fahad ali journalist life close mine tell al jazeera approximately salt process unit huge rock salt boulder hand mine load truck dispatch say salt export raw form india importer process grind pack sale india mostly depend pakistan pink salt pahalgam killing india announce end trade pakistan reciprocate ban halt trade one series diplomatic economic tit tat measure neighbour take intense four day exchange missile drone take two country cusp full fledge war may step back brink agree truce however trade ban remain place salt trader india tell al jazeera current pause import start hamper business price start rise barely month since announcement ban price already go say gurveen singh amritsar base trader blame trader exist stock sell high price salt sell retail market rupee rupee per kilogramme ban now sell less rupee per kilogramme singh say place price even high kolkata week pink salt sell market rupee per kg idea situation return normal complete crisis stock get exhaust say rate however go even side india east due cost transport salt amritsar trader kolkata tell al jazeera price salt go percent city yet hamper demand himalayan rock salt remain huge demand across year especially festival people remain fast prefer pink salt marine salt produce india say sanjay agarwal manager private firm deal pink salt dinobondhu mukherjee salt trader kolkata say government look alternative country procure salt relation two country usually strain affect trade government look alternative country procure salt supply chain never disrupt mukherjee tell al jazeera pakistani exporter however say indian ban positive impact trade indian trader say brand salt sell international market high price recent ban help us expand wipe competition india faizan panjwani chief operate officer karachi base rm salt tell al jazeera undoubtedly india big market lot potential want send salt value addition raw form salt already huge demand globally say trade two country decrease since attack security force pulwama indian administer kashmir security personnel kill response india revoke non discriminatory market status good know favour nation mfn status grant pakistan ensure equal treatment trade partner also impose heavy tariff percent import pakistan accord india ministry commerce country export pakistan april january stand be pakistan export india period paltry india import metric tonne pink salt far low metric tonne import largely result high tariff prior late ban india major export pakistan include cotton organic chemical spice food product pharmaceutical plastic article dairy product india normally import copper article raw cotton fruit salt mineral speciality chemical pakistan implementation heavy duty raise import price salt rupee per kilogramme rupee per kilogramme even though salt route country like dubai trader kumar tell al jazeera still impact business demand high buyer ready pay price government time also prohibit entry pakistani good country bring supply complete standstill say one unusual industry hurt ban lamp make himalayan pink rock salt use decorative light even tout unproven claim air purifier look alternative country supply rock salt doesn come pakistan say global aroma founder deep use single name price lamp already increase imposition percent tariff procurement country lead escalation cost"

"India general admits jet losses in clash with Pakistan: Here’s what he said","Anil Chauhan, India’s chief of defence staff, says India experienced losses in the air but denies six planes downed.","Published On 1 Jun 20251 Jun 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/1/india-general-admits-jet-losses-in-clash-with-pakistan-heres-what-he-said","tag/india-pakistan-tensions/","General Anil Chauhan, India’s chief of defence staff, has admitted that an unspecified number of its jets were shot down during its conflict with Pakistan last month. The acknowledgement of aerial losses by the country’s highest-ranking general comes weeks after the two South Asian neighbours were engaged in their heaviest fighting in decades, which involved fighter planes and cruise missiles. Indian officials had previously refused to confirm or deny Pakistani claims of downing Indian jets. The conflict was triggered after armed men killed 26 tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Pahalgam town on April 22. India’s first official admission of a loss of fighter jets came during Chauhan’s interviews on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore. India carried out strikes on what it called “terror infrastructure” in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on May 7 in retaliation for the Pahalgam attack. India blamed armed groups backed by Pakistan for the April 22 attack. An armed group called The Resistance Front (TRF) claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam killings. India accused TRF of being an offshoot of the Pakistan-based armed group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Pakistan denied involvement, condemning the Pahalgam attack and calling for a neutral investigation. India claimed to have targeted at least six cities in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on the first day of the conflict. Pakistan initially asserted that it had downed six Indian jets in retaliation. But a senior Pakistan official later told Al Jazeera that five Indian aircraft were shot down in the aerial battle. India did not confirm or deny the Pakistani claims. “Losses are a part of combat,” Air Marshal AK Bharti, India’s director general of air operations, said at a news conference on May 11. The Indian embassy in China called reports of the downing of jets “disinformation”. After that, tit-for-tat cross-border attacks across the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border between India- and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, rattled the region, renewing fears of a nuclear war. On May 10, United States President Donald Trump announced that the two countries had reached a ceasefire, potentially averting a “nuclear disaster”. India and Pakistan have given competing claims on casualties in the fighting, but more than 70 people were killed on both sides. Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full but administer only parts of the Muslim-majority Himalayan territory. Here is what Chauhan said in recent interviews with the Reuters news agency and Bloomberg TV: Chauhan admitted that India suffered air losses on the first day of fighting without providing details. In an interview with Reuters, he said: “What was important is why did these losses occur and what we’ll do after that.” The general said, after the losses, the Indian army “rectified tactics” and then went back on May 7, 8 and 10 “in large numbers to hit airbases deep inside Pakistan, penetrated all their air defences with impunity, carried out precision strikes”. He added that the Indian air force “flew all types of aircraft with all types of ordnances” on May 10. Islamabad acknowledged that its airbases suffered minimal losses but denied that it had lost any planes. When a Bloomberg reporter asked Chauhan about Pakistan’s claims that six Indian jets were downed, Chauhan responded that this information was incorrect. He went on to say: “What is important is … not the jets being downed but why they were downed.” Some media outlets inferred that his statement appeared to imply that many jets were lost in the aerial battle. The general did not provide details about the number of jets downed or specifics about what these rectified tactics were. The Pakistani military said India did not fly its jets in the conflict again after suffering air losses. Media reports suggested that some attacks were near Pakistan’s nuclear sites, but the nuclear infrastructure itself was not a target. “Most of the strikes were delivered with pinpoint accuracy, some even to a metre [3.3ft] to whatever was our selected mean point of impact,” Chauhan told Reuters. He had previously provided assurances that India was not considering using nuclear weapons during the conflict. The chairman of Pakistan’s joint chiefs of staff, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, has done the same for his country. “I think there’s a lot of space before that nuclear threshold is crossed, a lot of signalling before that. I think nothing like that happened. There’s a lot of space for conventional operations which has been created, and this will be the new norm,” Chauhan said. He added that on both sides, the most “rational people are in uniform” during conflict because they understand the consequences of “this kind of conflict”. “I found both sides displaying a lot of rationality in their thoughts as well as actions. So why should we assume that in the nuclear domain there will be irrationality on someone else’s part?” Chauhan said while Pakistan enjoys a close alliance with China, there was no sign that Beijing helped Islamabad during the conflict. China sits on India’s northern and northeastern borders, and controls a barely inhabited northeastern zone in Kashmir called Aksai Chin. “We didn’t find any unusual activity in the operational or tactical depth of our northern borders, and things were generally all right,” Chauhan said. When asked whether China provided Pakistan with intelligence information such as satellite imagery, the Indian general said such information is commercially available, and Pakistan could have obtained it from China or other sources. However, Chauhan said “almost 80 percent of the equipment” in Pakistan has been procured from China in the past few years. From 2020 to 2025, China supplied 81 percent of Pakistan’s arms imports, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Chinese jets got a boost after media reports said Pakistan used Chinese-manufactured J-10C fighters in the air battle. The Chinese government did not officially confirm that the J-10C jets were used to down Indian planes, but state broadcaster CCTV posted on social media on May 17 that the jets achieved actual combat results for the first time. Chauhan said while hostilities have ceased, India would “respond precisely and decisively should there be any further terror attacks emanating from Pakistan”. He added that this will be a new normal for India. “So that has its own dynamics as far [as] the armed forces are concerned. It will require us to be prepared 24/7.” The president of the main opposition Indian National Congress party said Chauhan’s admission warrants a review of India’s defence preparedness. “There are some very important questions which need to be asked. These can only be asked if a Special Session of the Parliament is immediately convened,” Mallikarjun Kharge wrote in an X post on Saturday. Referring to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he added: “The Modi Govt has misled the nation. The fog of war is now clearing.” “We salute [the Indian military’s] resolute courage and bravery,” Kharge said. “However, a comprehensive strategic review is the need of the hour.” The Congress has called the Pahalgam attack a “security and intelligence failure” and sought accountability, given that Indian-administered Kashmir is directly governed from New Delhi. But Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, DC, said Chauhan’s interviews do not “change the war narrative in a big way”. “It confirms the jet losses that so many observers had assumed while emphasising the battlefield achievements of India that are already well known,” Kugelman told Al Jazeera. Still, the analyst said, the acknowledgement that Indian planes were downed “has triggered an uncomfortable question for New Delhi, and one that even some government supporters are posing: Why did it take so long to acknowledge a loss that [New] Delhi has shrugged off as inconsequential?” Kugelman argued, “India’s silence ended up emboldening Pakistan’s narrative and put India on the defensive and having to face awkward questions from global media.” “One can argue that had [New] Delhi earlier on acknowledged the jet losses while in the same breath focusing attention on its achievements, it would not have to be in reactive and defensive mode now on this issue,” he said.","general anil chauhan india chief defence staff admit unspecified numb jet shoot conflict pakistan last month

"India top general admits aerial ‘losses’ in recent conflict with Pakistan","General Anil Chauhan appears to confirm India lost at least one jet during conflict with Pakistan earlier this month.","Published On 31 May 202531 May 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/31/india-top-general-admits-losses-in-recent-conflict-with-pakistan","tag/india-pakistan-tensions/","India’s chief of defence staff says the country suffered initial losses in the air during a recent military conflict with neighbouring Pakistan, but declined to give details. “What was important is, why did these losses occur, and what we will do after that,” General Anil Chauhan told the Reuters news agency on Saturday on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore. India and Pakistan were engaged in a four-day conflict this month, their worst standoff since 1999, before a ceasefire was agreed on May 10. More than 70 people were killed in missile, drone and artillery fire on both sides, but there are competing claims on the casualties. India says more than 100 “terrorists” were killed in its “precision strikes” on several “terror camps” across Pakistan, which rejects the claim, saying more than 30 Pakistani civilians were killed in the Indian attacks. New Delhi, meanwhile, says nearly two dozen civilians were killed on the Indian side, most of them in Indian-administered Kashmir, along the disputed border.    The fighting between the two nuclear powers was triggered by an attack on tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22 that killed 26 people, almost all of them tourists. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for supporting the armed group behind the attack, an allegation Islamabad denied. During their conflict, Pakistan had also claimed to have downed at least five Indian military jets, including at least three Rafale fighters. But Chauhan on Saturday dismissed it as “absolutely incorrect”, confirming his country had lost at least one aircraft. “I think what is important is that, not the jet being down, but why they were being down,” he told Bloomberg TV in a separate interview in Singapore. On May 11, a day after the ceasefire, India’s Air Marshal AK Bharti told reporters in New Delhi that “all our pilots are back home”, adding that “we are in a combat scenario, and that losses are a part of combat”. Chauhan said on Saturday India switched tactics after suffering losses in the air on the first day of conflict and established a decisive advantage. “So we rectified tactics and then went back on the [May] 7th, 8th and 10th in large numbers to hit airbases deep inside Pakistan, penetrated all their air defences with impunity, carried out precision strikes,” he said. Islamabad has denied it suffered any losses of planes but has acknowledged its airbases suffered some hits, although losses were minimal. Chauhan said while the fighting had ceased, the Indian government had made it clear that it would respond “precisely and decisively should there be any further terror attacks emanating from Pakistan”. “So that has its own dynamics as far [as] the armed forces are concerned. It will require us to be prepared 24/7,” he said. Chauhan also said that although Pakistan is closely allied with China, which borders India in the north and the northeast, there was no sign of any actual help from Beijing during the conflict. “While this was unfolding from [April] 22nd onwards, we didn’t find any unusual activity in the operational or tactical depth of our northern borders, and things were generally all right,” he told Reuters. Asked whether China may have provided any satellite imagery or other real-time intelligence to Pakistan during the conflict, Chauhan said such imagery was commercially available and could have been procured from China as well as other sources.","india chief defence staff say country suffer initial loss air recent military conflict neighbour pakistan decline give detail important loss occur general anil chauhan tell reuters news agency saturday sideline shangri la dialogue security forum singapore india pakistan engage four day conflict month bad standoff since ceasefire agree may people kill missile drone artillery fire side compete claim casualty india say terrorist kill precision strike several terror camp across pakistan reject claim say pakistani civilian kill indian attack new delhi meanwhile say nearly two dozen civilian kill indian side indian administer kashmir along dispute border fight two nuclear power trigger attack tourist pahalgam indian administer kashmir april kill people almost tourist new delhi blame pakistan support arm group behind attack allegation islamabad deny conflict pakistan also claim down less five indian military jet include less three rafale fighter chauhan saturday dismiss absolutely incorrect confirm country lose less one aircraft think important jet tell bloomberg tv separate interview singapore may day ceasefire india air marshal ak bharti tell reporter new delhi pilot back home add combat scenario loss part combat chauhan say saturday india switch tactic suffer loss air first day conflict establish decisive advantage rectify tactic go back may th th th large number hit airbases deep inside pakistan penetrate air defence impunity carry precision strike say islamabad deny suffer loss plane acknowledge airbases suffer hit although loss minimal chauhan say fight cease indian government make clear respond precisely decisively terror attack emanate pakistan dynamic far arm force concern require us prepare say chauhan also say although pakistan closely ally china border india north northeast sign actual help beijing conflict unfold april nd onward didn find unusual activity operational tactical depth northern border thing generally right tell reuters ask whether china may provide satellite imagery real time intelligence pakistan conflict chauhan say imagery commercially available procure china good source"

Yet, this week, he was back in both countries, as part of a five-day, four-nation diplomatic blitzkrieg also including stops in Iran and Tajikistan, where Sharif will hold talks on Thursday and Friday. And he isn’t alone: Sharif is being accompanied by Army Chief Asim Munir – recently promoted to Pakistan’s only second-ever field marshal – and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar. Their destinations might be familiar, but the context has changed dramatically since Sharif’s previous visits. More than two weeks after a four-day standoff between Pakistan and India – during which they exchanged missile and drone attacks – diplomacy has become the new battlefront between the South Asian neighbours. India has launched a global diplomatic campaign, sending delegations to more than 30 countries, accusing Pakistan of supporting “terrorist groups” responsible for attacks in India and Indian-administered Kashmir. “We want to exhort the world to hold those responsible for cross-border terrorism accountable, those who have practiced this for 40 years against India, that is Pakistan. Their actions need to be called out,” said Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External Affairs, last week. On April 22, gunmen killed 26 people, most of them tourists, in Pahalgam, a hill resort in Indian-administered Kashmir, in the worst such attack on civilians in years. India blamed the killings on The Resistance Front (TRF), which it alleges is linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a Pakistan-based group designated as a “terrorist” entity by the United Nations. New Delhi accused Islamabad of complicity in the attacks. Pakistan denied the allegations, calling for a “transparent, credible, independent” investigation. Then, on May 7, India launched a series of missiles aimed at what it said was “terrorist infrastructure” in parts of Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Islamabad insisted that the missiles struck civilians, mosques and schools. More than 50 people, including at least 11 security personnel, were killed in the Indian missile attacks. This was followed by drone incursions and, on May 10, both sides fired missiles at each other’s military bases, as they stood on the brink of a full-fledged war before they agreed to a ceasefire that the United States says it brokered. Now, Pakistan, say officials and analysts, is looking to flip India’s narrative before the world – projecting itself as an advocate of peace and stability in South Asia, and New Delhi as the aggressor looking to stoke tensions.  On Wednesday, Sharif expressed willingness to engage in dialogue with India on “all matters” if India reciprocates “in all sincerity”. Speaking at a trilateral summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan, Sharif said trade could resume if India cooperated on all issues, including “counterterrorism”. “I have said in all humility that we want peace in the region, and that requires talks on the table on issues which need urgent attention and amicable resolution, that is the issue of Kashmir, according to the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council, and as per the aspirations of the people of Kashmir,” he said. Kashmir, a picturesque valley in the northeastern subcontinent, remains the root of conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations since their independence in 1947. A 1948 UN resolution called for a plebiscite to determine Kashmir’s future, but eight decades later, it has yet to take place. India and Pakistan each administer parts of Kashmir, while China controls two small regions. India claims the entire territory; Pakistan claims the portion administered by India, but not the areas held by Pakistan’s ally, China. But there are other motivations driving Pakistan’s diplomatic outreach, say officials and experts. India’s diplomatic delegations that are currently touring the world include members from various political parties, including the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Indian National Congress (INC), projecting a unified stance. In contrast, Pakistan’s current mission is led by top state officials, including Sharif and army chief Munir, widely considered the most powerful figure in the country.  The trip also reflects strategic alignment, say analysts. Turkiye, whose drones were used by Pakistan in the recent conflict, is a key defence partner. “Pakistan’s defence cooperation with Turkey is especially deep,” said Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the University at Albany. “Evidence suggests several Turkish-origin systems were used in this recent clash, with varying levels of effectiveness, so there is much to talk about between the two,” he told Al Jazeera. Khurram Dastgir Khan, a former federal minister for foreign affairs and defence, is part of a Pakistani delegation set to visit the US, United Kingdom and European Union headquarters in Brussels next month. He said the current trip by Sharif, Munir and Dar is at least partly about highlighting Pakistan’s capacity to wage a modern war against a larger adversary. “There is immense interest in how Pakistan fought the recent war,” Khan said. “There are countries deeply interested in learning the details, what capabilities Pakistan used and what Indians had,” he added. “This opens new strategic possibilities for Pakistan’s defence forces to provide training to others. We are battle-tested. This makes us highly sought after, not just in the region but globally.” Pakistan relied heavily on Chinese-supplied weaponry, including the fighter jets and missiles it deployed against India, and the air defence systems it used to defend itself from Indian missiles. Though both countries claimed victory after the conflict, the battle over narratives has since raged across social media and public forums. Pakistan claims to have downed six Indian jets, a claim neither confirmed nor denied by India, while Indian missiles penetrated deep into Pakistani territory, revealing vulnerabilities in Pakistan’s air defences. India has also suspended the six-decade-old Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a critical water-sharing agreement that is vital to Pakistan. Recently, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged Pakistanis to reject “terrorism”. “Live a life of peace, eat your bread or choose my bullet,” Modi said, during a speech in India’s Gujarat state. He also criticised the IWT as “badly negotiated”, claiming it disadvantaged India. Muhammad Shoaib, an academic and security analyst at Quaid-i-Azam University, said Modi’s remarks reflected “ultra-nationalism” and were targeted at a domestic audience. “The Indian diplomatic teams won’t likely focus on what Pakistan says. They will only implicate Pakistan for terrorism and build their case. Meanwhile, the Pakistani delegation will likely use Modi’s statements and international law regarding the IWT to bolster their arguments,” he told Al Jazeera. Khan, who is also a senior member of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN), the governing party which premier Sharif belongs to, said the upcoming diplomatic mission that he will be part of will focus on issues like India’s suspension of the IWT. “Our fundamental point is that Pakistan seeks to maintain lasting peace in South Asia, but three major hurdles are posed by Indian aggression,” he said. The first, according to Khan, is “Indian-sponsored terrorism” in Pakistan, in which, he claimed, more than 20 people have been killed over the past four years. India has been accused by the US and Canada of transnational assassinations. In January 2024, Pakistan also accused India of carrying out killings on its soil. India denies involvement. Pakistan also accuses India of backing separatist groups in its Balochistan province – again, an allegation that India rejects. “The second point is India’s utterly irresponsible suspension of the IWT,” Khan said. “Pakistan has rightly said that any step by India to stop our water will be treated as an act of war. This is something that can bring all the region in conflict and I believe that if India acquires capability to divert waters in next six to 10 years, and tries to do so, it will lead to a war,” Khan warned. The third issue, Khan said, is Pakistan’s concern over India’s “status as a responsible nuclear power”. In the past, New Delhi has frequently cited the nuclear proliferation facilitated by Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, as evidence that Islamabad cannot be trusted with the safe management of its nuclear weapons. But in recent days, India’s internal security minister, Amit Shah – widely viewed as the country’s second-most powerful leader after Modi – has confirmed that India used its homegrown BrahMos missile against Pakistan during the recent military escalation. The BrahMos, developed with Russia, is a supersonic cruise missile capable of Mach 3 – three times the speed of sound – and a range of 300 to 500km (200 to 300 miles). It can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads and be launched from land, air, or sea. Khan, who served as defence minister from 2017 to 2018, warned of “unimaginable consequences” from using such weapons. “Once the missile is in the air, you cannot know what payload it carries until it hits the target. This is very, very irresponsible,” he said. “India has already shown recklessness when it mistakenly fired a missile into our territory a few years ago.” Khan was referring to an incident in March 2022, when India fired a BrahMos “accidentally” into Pakistani territory, where it fell in the densely populated city of Mian Channu, roughly 500km (300 miles) south of capital Islamabad. India at the time acknowledged that accidental launch was due to a “technical malfunction” and later sacked three air force officials. While the conflict brought both countries to the edge of war, the ceasefire declared on May 10 has held, with troops gradually returning to peacetime positions. Shoaib, also a research fellow at George Mason University in the US, expressed cautious optimism. “Initiating hostilities is risky. No side wants to be seen as irresponsible. For that to break, it would take a major incident,” he said. Tughral Yamin, a former military officer and researcher in Islamabad, noted that while diplomacy offers no guarantees, the ceasefire could last. “India has seen that Pakistan is no cakewalk. It has both conventional and nuclear deterrence,” he told Al Jazeera. “Both sides will remain alert, and Pakistan must address weaknesses exposed in the standoff.” Clary added that while the India-Pakistan relationship remains fragile, history suggests that intense clashes are often followed by calmer periods. “It is reasonable for both countries and international observers to hope for the best but prepare for the worst over the next few months,” he said. But Khan, the former minister, questioned Modi’s comments after the military crisis, where the Indian PM said any attack on the country’s soil would now be seen as worthy of a military response, and that New Delhi would cease to draw any distinction between Pakistan’s military and non-state armed groups. “The new stated policy of the Indian government is to attack Pakistan even after minor incidents, without waiting for evidence. This puts the entire region on edge,” he said. “This trigger-happy policy should concern not just Pakistan, but the entire world.”","islamabad pakistan pakistan prime minister shehbaz sharif visit
